## Introduction

AI-GovLINK aims to bridge the gap between complex government information and its intended audiences, whether human or artificial, to improve understanding and utilization of government data. Without impacting any current functionality, we can augment a website and its associated knowledge base so that it is discoverable and usable by emerging AI technology.

## Features

- Embedded instructional prompting for AI agents
- Enhanced knowledge retrieval for AI Agent
- Optimized conversational content exploration vs keyword-based search (Query Instructions, Query Examples, Chain of Thought)
- AI Optimized Badge to provide explainability to the end-user

## Usage

Note: this site contains mocked data and is not intended to be used as a production example. This site is intended to be used, to support AI Agent/LLM based searches.

The below examples are intended to be used from something like ChatGPT, Groq, etc.

## Examples

- I want to submit a proposal to NSF to understand and process animal sounds and language. Is my idea or topic already funded at NSF? Which program and program officer can I talk to about my idea?”

- I want to know about the awards made to <abc> organization/university by area of science and award size. In addition, tell me if the Principal Investigators or Co-Principal Investigators on any of the awards appear on awards to other organizations, break that down by area of science as well.
