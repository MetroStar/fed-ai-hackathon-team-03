        "Abstract": "With the proliferation of automation and electronic devices throughout most major industries, the amount of data being produced and the need to process/manage that data continues to grow. Automated management of data centers, addressing their emerging thermal challenges and improving their energy efficiency form the key to addressing this demand. The Center for Energy-Smart Electronic Systems (ES2), an NSF Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC), was established in 2011 to address these needs for data centers. This award provides a Phase III renewal for this 3-site IUCRC, which consists of Binghamton University, Villanova University and University of Texas at Arlington. ES2's vision is to develop systematic methodologies for operating electronic systems, including data centers, as dynamic, self- sensing and regulating systems that are predictable and verified in real time. The focus in Phase I and Phase II has been to develop new energy-optimization and thermal management models and designs, as well as tools and algorithms enabling electronic data systems to operate more efficiently and securely. Phase III will further expand on these methodologies to progress closer to a full realization of the ES2 vision. The Center brings together computer scientists, electrical engineers, and mechanical engineers in a synergistic multidisciplinary team to advance industrially relevant research in this area. ES2, in promoting significant reductions in energy consumption in electronic systems, will contribute to the national agenda of eventually reaching net-zero carbon emissions. Reducing energy costs in data centers will help to allow computing services to be more deployable and accessible for a larger population segment. ES2 continues to attract a diverse group of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels and provides industrially relevant training in their careers beyond graduation. ES2 has also integrated a variety of mechanisms across the partners universities and industry members to increase participation by women and underrepresented students. <br/><br/>The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) site has grown its facilities, specifically hardware, to support ES2, often in collaboration with the Center?s industry members. Currently there is a modular data center laboratory consisting of a direct/indirect evaporative cooling unit that has been developed in collaboration with a Center partner; in Phase III this will be augmented with a second spray-based indirect evaporative cooling unit. In Phase III, there will be a considerable focus at UTA on immersion cooling, an important industry sector that is predicted to experience significant growth in the next five years. Immersion cooling applications span high-performance computing, edge computing, and cryptocurrency mining, amongst others. UTA has invested in significant infrastructure to support this important area of research, including resources for a newly renovated state-of-the-art immersion cooling lab as well as a PIV for experiments related to immersion cooling. As such, in Phase III, UTA will be conducting both experimental and computational immersion cooling research. The test laboratories also offer educational value by serving as a practical demonstration of technology and heat transfer principles for both undergraduates as well as high school students participating in UTA?s summer programs. These facilities support the educational and workforce development missions of ES2; the UTA site has a strong track record of providing highly trained STEM graduates to industry, including many of the Center?s members.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This award supports a full-time laboratory technician for five years at the University of Texas at Arlington Luminescence Laboratory (UTALL). This technician will expand access to luminescence dating services for the broader Earth Science community, especially to undergraduate and graduate students. Twenty-five percent of the technician?s time is dedicated to student training, including students within PI Brown?s research group, as well as undergraduate and graduate students in his Geochronology course , and support to external visitors. The UTALL is a laboratory partner for the Advancing Geochronology Science, Spaces, and Systems (AGeS3) program, an NSF-funded initiative that provides micro-funding opportunities to pair graduate students and underrepresented individuals across the United States with geochronology laboratories. The UTALL houses several unique instruments that are unavailable elsewhere in the United States and are thus uniquely valuable to external visitors. The technician will also develop freely available software for luminescence thermochronology analysis for the broader scientific community; presently this type of analysis is only done at a few universities including UTA owing in part to a lack of software. PI Brown and the technician will demonstrate existing and developed software at the New World Luminescence Dating Workshop, an annual meeting of luminescence dating specialists, which they will host. Additionally, the technician would help maintain research facilities, develop more accessible data archiving practices, and engage in community outreach activities.<br/><br/>The technician will enhance a variety of research projects at the UTALL, the majority of which involve novel luminescence measurements of sediment or bedrock samples. Most of these projects, 18 currently planned, include graduate students, many of whom will visit the UTALL, and PIs who are early career researchers. Results from these projects will include the first measurements of ventifact erosion rates, the first luminescence ages of hydrothermal explosion deposits in Yellowstone National Park, the first luminescence-based exhumation histories of tectonic blocks in Southern California, and the first use of luminescence measurements to constrain boulder comminution on hillslopes. Other projects will determine paleoseismic records along several fault strands globally and records of ice sheet retreat in Greenland and Antarctica. The UTALL also hosts several unique analytical capabilities. It is the only US luminescence dating laboratory with a focus on luminescence thermochronology, it hosts the only infrared photo-stimulated luminescence rock slab imaging device in the US, which is used to measure sunlight exposure ages or erosion rates of hard rock surfaces. UTALL will soon host the first hydrostatic pressure vessel to test signal resetting within a luminescence dating laboratory, which the technician will help maintain and run.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Solar eclipse event on April 8, 2024, provides an excellent opportunity to scientists for engaging in outreach efforts and to investigate the influence of reduction in the ionizing source on our Earth?s atmosphere. This workshop intends to organize educational activities at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), which is on the path of totality. It means that the moon completely obscures the sun and for this event in April, the totality will last for about 4 minutes.  This short period of darkness offers a direct observing window where people can observe solar corona using safety goggles and collect data using scientific instruments. Scientists at UTA plan to take advantage of the upcoming solar eclipse and will use their state-of the-art Planetariums and telescopes to create public awareness and bring K-12 students to these facilities.<br/><br/>The scientific workshop will be held for two days between April 8 ? 10, 2024. Prior to this event, several activities are planned to enable proper dissemination of information about the solar eclipse to K-12 students. The team will distribute educational materials and safety goggles by visiting different schools in the area between March 18 ? 31, 2024. Technical support from International Astronomical Union (IAU) to facilitate observations using UTA telescopes and their access to public is also planned. This workshop will promote inter-disciplinary collaborations, encourage interactions between students and space-scientists. UTA will host several scientific instruments to address questions about (a) the spatial and temporal variability of Corona during totality and (b) response of the ionosphere-thermosphere system to solar eclipse? To investigate the first topic, use of professional four Maxvision ED80 telescopes (narrowband) and two spectral telescopes in a relative broad wavelength will be used. Several GNSS receivers will be used to explore the effects of solar eclipse on the Earth?s ionosphere-thermosphere region. This grant is in response to NSF 23-014, ?Dear Colleague letter: Great American Solar Eclipses 2023 and 2024? to support science, education and outreach activities related to Solar Eclipses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) project will advance knowledge within and across engineering disciplines, physics, education/assessment, and unique challenges of sustainable and resilient urban infrastructure, by finding solutions for critical issues. This is important with the deteriorating infrastructure, its widespread failures and extensive human, economic and societal effects, increased worldwide occurrence of hazards, and the critical need for economic and environmental conservation in urban settings, such as in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Metroplex with a population of seven million. Teachers will be immersed in hands on cutting-edge research under expert mentoring and intellectual collaboration, designed to broaden their educational experience and student learning. Addressing original research questions for each project will enable teachers to find transformative solutions with potential for practical applications. Teachers will be engaged in research activities and provided with financial, mentoring, and other supports to transfer the research into their school curricula. They will integrate engineering topics and innovatively address state education standards. Significant student fractions in the target school districts are underrepresented minorities, economically disadvantaged or at risk of dropping out. Allowing teachers to tailor curricular modules in STEM courses related to solutions of real-world engineering problems will improve student engagement. Further, teachers will employ universal design for learning in their teaching and assessment, improving education opportunities for all students. Increased student engagement in STEM courses and exposure to practical applications is expected to increase student interest in engineering education and careers. The societal benefits of sustainable and resilient infrastructure will enhance this impact, considering the nation?s failing infrastructure and recent challenges in extreme events.  The project will enhance long-term collaboration among pre- and in-service teachers, university faculty/students and industrial/academic mentors. Strong societal impacts from improved public safety, health, and welfare, through investigating and devising solutions to challenges of urban infrastructure are expected.<br/><br/>This is a new RET Site with seven participating school districts, as follows: Arlington, Duncanville, Everman, Grand Prairie, Irving, Kennedale, and Mansfield, all in the DFW metroplex. The main and sub-fields of the research are infrastructure sustainability and resiliency, engineering (civil, industrial, electrical); science (physics), education and assessment. The project involves participation of 12 high school level STEM teachers in the summer RET Site. Teachers will actively participate in six summer projects over six weeks each summer. The RET Site is designed to improve: (1) teachers? ability to include engineering topics into their course modules; (2) high school students? perceptions of and interest in STEM majors and careers; and (3) high school student engagement.  The project will provide pre-service and in-service high school teachers, primarily from inner city and other high-needs schools, with stipends/support for engagement in research with faculty/students, industrial/academic advisors and prior RET teachers. Summer activities include curricular module development, workshops, webinars, mentoring and site visits. Follow-up during the academic year includes a workshop to share developed modules with non-RET teachers, classroom visitations, evaluation, and dissemination. The teachers will be tracked for five years post the RET program. An external evaluator will perform formative/summative process and outcome evaluations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Non-technical description:<br/>Quantum communication uses fundamental laws of physics to securely exchange private information over untrusted networks and to establish quantum correlations among distant network nodes, which could be used for high-performance distributed quantum computing and ultra-precise quantum sensing. The capacity of quantum communication links is limited by the unavoidable losses of optical fibers connecting the nodes, and the only way to grow the quantum information exchange rate at a given distance is to increase the number of degrees of freedom (modes) over which the information is transmitted. While polarization and frequency / time modes have already received a lot of attention, one untapped resource for quantum information exchange over long fiber links is the spatial degrees of freedom of light in few-mode, multimode, and multi-core optical fibers. In this project, the research team harnesses the spatial degrees of freedom of light for carrying the quantum information over significant distances in optical fibers. Several types of high-capacity quantum communication links are investigated, ranging from a set of totally independent spatial quantum channels to links using spatial modes for high-dimensional data encoding. The project pairs University of Texas at Arlington, which has a nascent Quantum Information Science and Technology (QISE) program, with well-established and vibrant QISE research effort at Northwestern University. Through the joint research and student exchange, as well as collaboration with industrial and worldwide partners, the students of all levels, including those of underrepresented groups, are being trained at the forefronts of quantum science and optical communications. This collaborative work and the associated broad public and K-12 outreach activities, such as high-school summer camps and Engineering Week?s open lab visits and demos, aim to establish University of Texas at Arlington as a center for the emerging and productive QISE research community in North Texas. <br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>This project?s goal is to increase the quantum communication capacity by exploiting spatial degrees of freedom of optical fibers. It extends the methods used in classical space-division multiplexing to the quantum domain to develop several types of high-capacity quantum communication links. These range from a set of totally independent spatial quantum channels to links maintaining full spatial coherence across many fiber modes or cores for transmission of quantum information encoded in high-dimensional spatial Hilbert space. The project employs a systematic approach to real-time characterization and inversion of the input-output transfer matrix of an optical fiber to enable the delivery of parallel-channel or high-dimensional qubits over metroscale distances, thus dramatically increasing the quantum communication capacity or rate at such reach. These techniques may also enable the transmission of spatially-broadband quantum states (quantum images) over km-scale lengths of multimode fiber, which can be useful in quantum sensing and metrology applications. The work engages the students with several industrial partners on development of customized few-mode and multi-core fibers, as well as fiber in/out couplers. A field-test of the developed methods is to be conducted over installed fibers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Natural reefs and their connected ecosystem play a vital role in sequestering carbon dioxide and in protecting coastal areas from climate change-induced extreme events, such as hurricanes, flooding, etc. Unfortunately, climate change-induced ocean acidification has damaged nearly 40% of the reefs and the dependent ecosystem. While artificial reefs with a wide range of materials have been constructed in the past few decades, the environmental impact and longevity of most of these materials remain concerning. To find a solution, this project will investigate the use of self-healing carbon-sequestering composite materials for artificial reef construction that will enable storage of carbon dioxide while also protecting coastal areas from rising seas and extreme floods. The successful completion of this project will benefit society by identifying a novel pathway to protect coastal communities from the immediate hazards of climate change and contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training, including the mentoring of three graduate students at the University of Texas at Arlington, a graduate and undergraduate student at Texas A&M University-Kingsville, a graduate student at the University of Texas-Dallas, and a graduate student at Texas A&M University.<br/><br/>This project aims to establish a novel pathway to design living engineered reefs that will enhance coastal resilience, store carbon, and restore habitat. The research goals are to: (i) investigate the process-structure-property relation of the self-healing carbon-negative composites to attain maximum carbon sequestration capacity with superior longevity in seawater; (ii)  understand the interactions across carbon-negative composites, surface algal, and microbial biofilms to ensure the settlement and growth of calcareous organisms on engineered reefs; (iii) investigate wave-structure interactions of 3D-printed engineered reefs via laboratory experiments to identify the optimal shape and void ratios of the reefs that will enable adequate wave attenuation while also providing habitat to marine life; and (iv) perform coastal hydrodynamic modeling to identify the optimal geophysical setup for deployment (location, dimensions, orientation) at which the engineered reef structure would produce quantifiable flood reduction in response to compound hazards of inland hydrologic variations, storm surge, ground subsidence, and sea level rise. In addition to research, the project team will provide hands-on learning opportunities to high school students via workshops on the STEM topics involved in this project including carbon sequestration, 3D printing, marine biology, and coastal flood modeling. The project team will also engage underserved communities through multiple workshops in collaboration with the Nature Conservancy and the Texas Sea Grant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The AGEP Faculty Career Pathways Alliance Model (FC-PAM) ?The University of Texas System Alliance? (UT System Alliance) promotes equity and inclusion in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) higher education. The goal of the AGEP UT System Alliance is to develop, implement, self-study, and institutionalize a University of Texas System AGEP career pathway model that provides (1) systemic change around policies and procedures for recruitment and hiring of, and (2) collaborative mentoring and sponsorship for the success of Black and African American, Latine and Hispanic American, Native American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Native Pacific Islander STEM doctoral candidates, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty members at the University of Texas campuses at Arlington, Austin, Dallas, El Paso, and San Antonio. The AGEP UT System Alliance provides inclusive mentoring and sponsorship for AGEP UT System Alliance participants around tools for success, and it promotes changes in culture and policy at each Alliance institution to create an ecosystem supportive of the professional development. Alliance activities are addressing non-inclusive practices and creating welcoming spaces for members of these groups as they ascend to careers in academia. The Alliance is working to improve the understanding of intersecting identities around ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, economic background, first generation status, faculty role and discipline, and family and community roles, as intersectional identities inform professional development activities for doctoral candidates, postdoctoral research scholars, and early career faculty members, as well as professional development for university leaders as part of systemic change strategies. The AGEP UT System Alliance is also adopting faculty hiring best practices for early career faculty hiring policies and practices. <br/><br/>Improving equity and inclusion is critical to advancing STEM faculty members, educating America?s future STEM workforce, fostering individual opportunity, and contributing to a thriving U.S. economy. The NSF AGEP program, therefore, funds grants that advance and enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and, consequently, mitigate the systemic inequities in the academic profession and workplace. FC-PAM awards are intended to support the development, implementation, evaluation, and institutionalization of Alliance models that will advance AGEP populations, within similar institutions of higher education. FC-PAM collaborators also study how socio-cultural, economic, structural, leadership and institutional variables affect the formation of the FC-PAM, and the strategies or interventions the collaborators implement to advance AGEP populations. <br/><br/>The Alliance has internal and external advisory boards with members who routinely review the AGEP UT System Alliance?s progress and strategize on future steps. An internal evaluator is leading the project?s self-study and formative assessment of the development and implementation of effective programming, institutional integration, and impacts. An external evaluator is providing summative assessment using a theory-based framework to assess the effectiveness of the AGEP UT System Alliance in recruiting, supporting, and retaining STEM doctoral candidates, postdoctoral scholars, and junior faculty members; the Alliance?s creation of career and  academic pathways; and the project?s impact on institutional integration for sustainability. The AGEP UT System Alliance team is disseminating the AGEP FC-PAM Model and project results through peer-reviewed and professional publications, an AGEP UT System Alliance website, and presentations at scientific and professional meetings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The UTA-RTG: Vertically Integrated Interdisciplinary Training in Mathematics for Human Health program at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) will train and mentor three multi-level cohorts of interdisciplinary researchers (a total of nine undergraduates, six Ph.D. students, and two postdoctoral researchers). The Research Training Group (RTG) will leverage on the fact that UTA is a Hispanic Serving Institution with a large population of veterans that offers a diverse recruitment pool with many groups historically underrepresented in the sciences. RTG teams will conduct research applying mathematical modeling to answer questions on topics in cancer biology, computational neurology, and vector-borne diseases. RTG scholars will be trained in mathematical theory and computational methods for diagnosis, assessment, prevention, and treatment of chronic and infectious diseases. Program activities will be led by a group of ten UTA Mathematics faculty, in collaboration with researchers from UTA Nursing, Bioengineering, Biology, and Psychology, as well as the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, the University of North Texas Health Science Center, and the VA North Texas Health Care System. The program?s experienced mentors draw on a best-practices model of multi-level mentoring in which faculty and trainees at all levels work together to share their own levels of expertise, producing researchers who are also ready to act as mentors, and in teams in biotechnology companies and health organizations as well as academia. <br/>  <br/>This RTG program integrates mentoring, interdisciplinary research, and coursework. The program research, guided by experimental work, will advance mathematics by developing state-of-the-art stochastic modeling and optimal control frameworks for the dynamics of cancer biomarkers, neuronal physiology, and immunological interactions between co-circulating vector-borne viruses; and efficient and accurate computational methodologies for solving differential and integral equations, as well as integrating modern data science and machine learning methods with the aforementioned classical techniques for analyzing data and solving the proposed mathematical problems. The program?s research experiences include: a weekly program seminar and group roundtables that develop research, teaching, and collaborative skills, while also providing exposure to ongoing interdisciplinary research work at UTA; hands-on research experiences and internships at off-campus RTG partner sites and UTA labs; and writing reports and presenting research results at conferences. The UTA-RTG program naturally builds on several federally funded mentoring and training programs at UTA and aligns well with institutional goals of enhancing interdisciplinary research, education, and community engagement in Health and the Human Condition.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Workforce program and the Mathematical Biology program at the Division of Mathematical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), located in the heart of the economically thriving, ethnically diverse Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metroplex and with an enrollment of more than 40,000 students, is the second largest in the University of Texas System. UTA is designated as both a Hispanic-Serving Institution and an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution with 57% of the undergraduate population identifying as underrepresented minority (URM) students. The goals of the Partnership in Research and Education in Materials (PREM) for Functional Materials between UTA and the Northwestern University (NU) Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) are to establish: (i) an interdisciplinary collaborative program at the cutting edge of materials research; (ii) an educational pathway for URM students by providing unique research and educational opportunities, comprehensive student mentoring, and professional development programs. The partnership also includes the participation of Grambling State University, an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), and involves reciprocal faculty visits and exposure of students to the world-class research and facilities at NU. The pathway begins at the undergraduate level and progresses through graduate school, ultimately culminating in postdoc opportunities and placement into materials science and engineering careers. <br/><br/><br/>The PREM in Functional Materials will focus on two research thrusts: (i) Functional Mixed-Dimensional Heterostructures and (ii) Bioinspired Materials with Adaptive Functionality. Research Thrust 1 addresses electron transport across mixed-dimensional heterostructures, in which the heterogeneities in dimensions (e.g., 0D, 2D, 3D) and materials properties are used to precisely control charge transport, allowing only electrons with a specific energy and momentum to participate in tunneling. This energy/momentum filtering lowers the effective electron temperature to extreme values (e.g., less than 1 K), allowing the study of ultra-cold electrons across mixed-dimensional heterojunctions at room temperature. Under this thrust, new generations of compound semiconductors, alloys, and epitaxial heterostructures will also be investigated. In addition, the role of chemical composition and material architecture (e.g., epitaxy) in influencing properties (e.g., electron affinity, dielectric constant, and band alignment) will be quantified. These results will have impact on practical applications including energy-efficient computing, neuromorphic devices, and biological and molecular sensing. In parallel, Research Thrust 2 will employ a fundamental materials science approach to study stimuli-responsive smart biomaterials and cell-free bioprogrammable materials, filling a void in the bioinspired materials field. Combining experimental investigations with computer simulations, three phase transition phenomena under different stimuli will be probed including: (a) pH-triggered conformational change in polydiacetylene-peptide; (b) glutathione-stimulated morphological change in polyurethane polymer nanoparticles; and (c) AC magnetic field-activated phase transition, from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, in polymeric nanocomposites containing superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Shape-morphing 3D materials with programmable morphologies and motions will also be synthesized, mimicking living tissues. This research will have far-reaching implications for the development of novel polymeric biomaterials and bioinspired materials that can be used for drug delivery, tissue repair and regeneration, and related biomedical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "With funding from the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Chemistry Division, Junha Jeon at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas at Arlington and Gyu Leem at the Department of Chemistry of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry are developing new methods to use inexpensive and environmentally benign silicon-based reagents to produce high-value chemicals and materials.  A number of chemical processes involve the transfer of both a hydrogen and an electron (the process is abbreviated HAT). This study utilizes silicon complexes in the presence of potassium to provide access to both hydrogen atom (hydrogen and one electron) and hydride (hydrogen and two electrons) transfer. If successful, these studies could provide low-cost, operationally simple, environmentally sustainable HAT and open up new avenues to the synthesis of key intermediates and useful polymeric materials. The broader impacts of this research include the recruitment and training of the next generation of scientists, with a particular emphasis on encouraging participation from women and underrepresented minority groups in the chemical sciences.   <br/><br/>This multi-disciplinary project involves Dr. Junha Jeon [synthetic silicon chemistry, University of Texas at Arlington] and Dr. Gyu Leem [polymer chemistry, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry] as the primary investigators. In addition, there are two additional collaborations involving Drs. Jiali Gao [computational, University of Minnesota] and Brad Pierce [EPR spectroscopy, University of Alabama]. Through theoretical and experimental methods, the mechanistic origin of 'hydrogen-hydride transfer duality' associated with a  potassiated hypercoordinate hydridosilicon species is determined. The  of 'hydrogen-hydride transfer duality' refers to a mode of competing single or two-electron transfer reactions of hypercoordinative hydrosilicon systems and is termed alkali metal Lewis base-catalyzed complexation-induced hydrogen atom transfer. In addition to the mechanistic investigations, (1) enantioselective redox-neutral, branch-selective olefin hydrosilylation via LBCI-HAT and (2) the extension of the process to alkali metal-Lewis base-catalyzed, hydrogen atom transfer radical polymerization (HATRP) and chain extension of HATRP for the synthesis of of multiblock copolymers are developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The nation is facing a critical need for STEM teachers.  The shortages are most severe in high-poverty urban districts and many of these districts are forced to employ teachers who are less qualified to teach STEM classes.  In response to the STEM teacher shortage in Dallas-Fort Worth (urban) school districts, this Track 1 Noyce project at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) seeks to address this need for high quality teachers by recruiting, preparing, inducting, and retaining teachers for secondary science, mathematics, and computer science to teach in high need schools.   Specific project objectives are to: 1) recruit mathematics, science, and computer science  teacher candidates from students at community colleges and baccalaureate programs, and career changers from local industry; 2) provide a quality teacher certification program for candidates with significant faculty mentoring, support, and professional development experiences integrated throughout the program; and 3) support and promote teacher induction and retention in the teaching profession, implementing various levels of guidance from professional educators, school-based Mentor Teachers, and Near-Peer Mentors. <br/><br/>This Noyce project builds upon previous successful UTA Noyce projects in partnership with the Dallas, Arlington, and Ft. Worth Independent School Districts.  The Tarrant County College is a community college partner that can assist in expanding the pipeline of new secondary science, mathematics, and computer science teachers.   One new aspect of this effort is the recruitment of computer science majors to the teaching profession.  This Noyce project seeks to provide scholarships to 50 STEM majors to prepare and certify them as highly qualified teachers in the shortage areas of science, mathematics, and computer science.   The project intends to provide summer internships to 40 STEM first year and sophomore students as a strategy for recruiting teacher candidates.   The project aims to give at least 33% of the scholarships to community college transfer students.  Eligible first- and second-year transfer students will have priority for summer internships.  Undergraduate and post-baccalaureate students will be given scholarships and pathways to earn teacher certification through UTA's nationally accredited UTeach Arlington program.  Additional project features and supports for Noyce Scholars include UTA faculty mentors; school-based Mentor Teachers throughout early field experiences, student teaching, and induction into the profession; a Near-Peer mentoring program; and Scholar Learning Seminars and conference participation as continuous professional development.  The UTA program's Noyce Scholar Leader (an experienced retired teacher) will provide sustained guidance through visits and support induction of new Noyce teachers into the profession.  This Noyce project includes an ongoing research component that aims to measure Noyce Scholars' learning and transition into teaching, including shifts in self-efficacy toward teaching, primary teaching practices, and views of the nature of mathematics and science disciplines.  The project also intends collect information on best practices in the recruitment, preparation, induction, and retention of new STEM teachers.  Results of this research will be presented at professional conferences and published in scholarly journals.  The primary benefit of this Noyce project will be the new science, mathematics, and computer science teachers produced who will serve in schools where they are most needed.  Other institutions of higher educations may also benefit from the results from the project's research effort and project evaluation, which may provide valuable information on best practices for preparing teachers for high need schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Heavy metals are continuously introduced into the atmosphere by natural and human activity, a process that endangers the health and well-being of the public and the environment. Current methods for measuring the presence of harmful metals in materials in the atmosphere require time-consuming processes to concentrate metal targets, as well as complicated sample preparation methods for the intricate analyses. A major limitation of these existing methods is that atmospheric materials have to be placed in water or other solvents to be analyzed. Significant advances in rapid, heavy metal detection could occur by direct light-based measurement of metals present in gases at the point of their generation (prior to entering the atmosphere). However, our understanding of how to detect heavy metals in gases using fluorescent light-based sensors is hindered by the inability to study molecular-level interactions between a metal of interest and fluorescent receptors that report metal presence. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging technologies may enhance the design of gas-phase sensors for heavy metal ions. These enabling technologies have the potential to offer early-stage detection of metal contamination to help prevent significant harm to human health and the environment. Recent advances in the single-entity fluorescence imaging of ions from gases have been made at the University of Texas at Arlington. This project brings together a unique combination of techniques to create sensitive gas-phase sensors that measure toxic heavy metals, with a focus on lead, mercury, and cadmium as some of the most harmful heavy metals. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school researchers in Dr. Frank Foss Jr.?s laboratory design and make sophisticated fluorescence imaging materials that are placed on optical surfaces.  These materials can then be used to assess presence of metals in the atmosphere. The research and training environment allows for learning about fundamentals of molecule-metal chemistry, photophysics, and cutting-edge approaches to making molecules, as well as scientific literacy and teamwork skills that propel the careers of the scientists in training.<br/><br/>With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program is funding Dr. Frank Foss Jr. at the University of Texas at Arlington to synthesize and study hybrid materials that directly investigate the fundamentals of heavy metal ion capture, surface dynamics, and fluorescence at gas-solid interfaces. Fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic properties are complicated by the seemingly irreversible nature of analyte binding in solvent-less environments and limited by methods that investigate bulk properties of ions on surfaces, rather than molecular properties. Turn-on, single-molecule fluorescence imaging (SMFI) methods have revolutionized our understanding of biomolecular and catalytic events at the molecular level in solution. Preparation of new turn-on fluorescence sensors containing rigid ion-selective receptors with solid-state functioning fluorophores provide SMFI materials that can be incorporated into self-assembled monolayers at gas-solid interfaces. To enhance ion binding selectivity, SMFI-SAMs are modified with solid electrolyte-inspired ion transport materials. Ion sensing and mobility measurements in SMFI-SE-SAMs are studied by microscopy and supported by computational experiments to enhance gas-phase sensing technologies and provide new tools for investigating surface design and function. These studies provide the molecular scale insight necessary for attaining ultra-low levels of detection by rapid gas sensitive fluorescent measurements. This interdisciplinary collaborative project brings together new materials with recently developed microscopy techniques to evaluate the measurement and selectivity of these devices to detect toxic heavy metal ions directly from the gas phase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This project aims to investigate how to build a reliable high-quality supply of STEM teachers for high-need school districts.  This work will contribute to the national need for educating a robust and diverse STEM workforce. The project will analyze whether and, if so, how scholarships provided by the Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program help to alleviate STEM teacher shortages. The project seeks also to provide insights about how to create partnerships between local school districts and higher education institutions. The collaborating institutions are in two populous states, and together serve both rural and urban school districts and cover multiple STEM disciplines. This research has the potential to raise awareness of challenges STEM teachers face in high-need settings and to suggest policy solutions to address these challenges.  In addition, the project will contribute to understanding the influence of the Noyce program on the STEM teacher workforce.<br/><br/>This project involves three core research institutions (Texas State University, Florida Atlantic University, and The Brookings Institution) and four collaborating institutions with Noyce programs (Texas State University, University of Texas at Arlington, University of West Florida, and Florida International University). The project will mine local and national databases for patterns that uncover the impact of Noyce projects on the supply of STEM teachers in the school districts they serve. The project seeks to raise awareness of challenges specific to STEM teachers in high-need settings, generate evidence-based policy solutions, and promote a better understanding of how Noyce projects influence the STEM teacher workforce. Project research questions include: (1) What are the characteristics of STEM teachers in high-need school districts and how have these characteristics changed over time? (2) What factors are associated with STEM teacher retention and persistence in high-need school districts? (3) What types of district or school programs or policies are associated with stronger STEM workforce measures? (4) What is the estimated impact of proximity to the Noyce program on the STEM teacher workforce in high-need school districts? (5) Do high-need school districts with higher proportions of Noyce graduates perform better on student outcomes or experience smaller race- or poverty-based gaps than other high-need school districts with fewer Noyce graduates? (6) What are the demographics and qualifications of the STEM teacher candidate pool, and how do they change during the training process? (7) Do different programs have varying levels of success getting candidates through their programs? (8) How do local high-need school districts perceive teachers coming from Noyce institutions? The research team will use secondary data and collect primary data to examine these questions. Secondary data will include several nationally representative surveys on teachers, schools, school districts, and principals administered by the National Center on Education Statistics. New primary data will be generated through interviews at collaborating institutions with Noyce programs and through the administration of an alumni survey. The research team will also work with collaborating Noyce institutions to extract and analyze program data on the selection and matriculation of teacher candidates. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). <br/><br/>The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), located in the heart of the economically thriving, ethnically diverse Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, is a major university in North Texas designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) with an enrollment of about 50,000 students and more than 45% underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates.  The goal of this Partnership in Research and Education in Materials (PREM)SEED project between UTA and the Northwestern University (NU) Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) is to establish (i) an interdisciplinary collaborative cutting-edge research program on functional materials; and (ii) an educational pipeline for URM students by providing research and educational opportunities, comprehensive student mentoring, and professional development programs. The partnership involves reciprocal faculty visits and exposure of students to research and facilities at NU. Undergraduate research is a core strategy for recruiting and retaining URM students in materials research along with programs in research experience for undergraduates at NU. The PREM program also involves the participation of Grambling State University (GSU), an HBCU institution, and the establishment of a network at UTA with GSU and other URM-serving institutions and national organizations to enable long-term, sustainable recruiting of URM students. <br/><br/>This PREM SEED project addresses two key fundamental aspects of functional materials research with major technological and societal impact. In the first focus area, electron transport and energy filtering across mixed-dimensional heterostructures will be explored. Thermal excitation of electrons broadens the electron energy distribution, which obscures or prevents the emergence of novel phenomena. A quantum state will be used as an energy filter, suppressing electron thermal distribution, and lowering the effective electron temperature. Therefore, electron transport through quantum states of different dimensionalities will be studied and the resulting electron energy distribution will be measured electrically and optically. This fundamental research has important applicability in quantum information technologies, energy-efficient electronics, and spintronics. The second focus area will deliver new hetero-anionic semiconductor functional materials with tunable properties that are otherwise inaccessible from simpler homo-anionic structures and chemistries. Advances in the computational identification of new, thermodynamically stable compounds will be leveraged, and the new compounds will be subjected to rigorous computer-aided prediction of optoelectronic properties. Time-efficient and energy-efficient synthetic routes for synthesizing these materials will be realized for rapid screening and technological implementation. The effort focuses on a largely overlooked materials class that promises tunable band structure along with high electronic mobility and optoelectronic attributes that are crucial for technological applications, such as solar energy conversion, magnetic, and optoelectronic devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry, the research team led by Professors Alexander Weiss, Varghese Chirayath, and Ali Koymen from the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) are developing a new technique to probe the chemical composition of otherwise inaccessible internal surfaces of porous materials. The research team at UTA has recently shown that the energy spectrum of gamma rays resulting from the annihilation of positrons (anti-matter electrons) with electrons at the surface can be used to determine the elemental composition of the topmost layer of external surfaces. The team is now working to demonstrate that positron-annihilation gamma spectroscopy can be used to reveal chemical changes to the hidden surfaces inside of nanoporous metals brought about by catalysis or reactive gas exposure. The project is aimed at the development of a hitherto unavailable tool for the chemical analysis of porous materials' internal surfaces.  The results of this research have potential impact across many areas of research, including catalysis, energy storage, gas separation, carbon capture, and dilute alloy design. The project provides training to undergraduate and graduate students in advanced surface modification and characterization methods. The students involved in this project are from the highly diverse student body of UTA, which is a Hispanic Serving Institution. The research team also collaborates with the STEM academy of the Arlington Independent School District (AISD) to provide training to select high-school students. Participation by students in the cutting-edge research of this project is serving to mold the next generation of leaders in advanced chemistry instrumentation and making a unique contribution to workforce development in this area of critical national need.<br/><br/>The response of catalytically active internal surfaces of porous materials to their environment strongly suggests that surface composition controls catalytic function, demonstrating the need for tools capable of probing internal surfaces with high surface selectivity under in operando conditions. There is a glaring absence of experimental methods that can non-destructively provide chemical information about the top atomic layer of internal surfaces that is free of interference from bulk signals. With the support of the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program, the positron research team at UTA is developing an in operando characterization tool for the inaccessible internal surfaces with elemental sensitives as low as 1% of the topmost atomic layer. The team is combining the superior surface selectivity of positron spectroscopy with the ability of 511 keV annihilation gamma radiation to exit through millimeters of sample or reaction cells without any loss of information. The unparalleled surface selectivity of the technique stems from the trapping of the implanted positrons in an image-potential well on the vacuum side of the sample surface before annihilation. As recently demonstrated by the UTA team, the energy spectrum of the gamma radiation resulting from the annihilation of the surface-trapped positrons reflects the elemental composition of the topmost atomic layer through the element-specific Doppler broadening of the annihilation gamma energy. Using calibration spectra obtained from controlled external surfaces to benchmark the Doppler broadened annihilation spectrum, the team is now developing the technique to measure the chemical composition at the internal surfaces of nanoporous gold (Au) and nanoporous copper (Cu), including variations that occur upon exposure to reactive gases or during catalysis. The research team is exploring the nature of catalytically active sites in these materials with the goal of providing a global view of the internal surface configuration of nanoporous Au and Cu under the action of reactive stimuli like ozone and carbon monoxide through controlled experiments in ultrahigh vacuum and in operando conditions. In addition to the scientific broader impacts of the work, the project provides advanced training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and supports outreach activities to engage local high school students in STEM research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "1 NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Rare-earth (RE) metals are critical components to past, present and future technologies and industries. RE metals are pervasive in society and pivotal in the growth and development of clean energy, defense, and even information technology applications, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, or communication devices (smartphones, satellites). As of today, only a handful countries around the world control the supply for these critical resources. Furthermore, current RE separation processes are environmentally damaging and highly energy intensive. It is therefore crucial and urgent to secure US leadership and autonomy in RE supply in a sustainable manner. With this Clean Energy Technology (CET) EAGER award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, researchers at the University of Texas Arlington address these challenges through fundamental investigations to create new materials to extract and separate RE metals using nanomaterials, including graphene. They prepare novel, versatile graphene-organic ligand hybrid materials to sustainably separate RE metals, thereby diversifying the RE supply chain and meeting national and global demands for RE. The multidisciplinary team comprises chemists and materials scientists that work in synergy to effectively advance the field of RE metal separation. The project also trains undergraduate and graduate students to contribute to the development of a future STEM workforce.<br/><br/>2 TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Rare Earth (RE) elements (Sc, Y, Lanthanides) are critical components in emerging technologies ranging from wind turbines and electric vehicle motors to defense applications. However, current industrial mining and separation processes rely on decades-old technologies that do not meet today?s standards in terms of efficiency and sustainability, and therefore, cannot sustain the growing global demand for RE elements. With this Clean Energy Technology (CET) EAGER award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, researchers at the University of Texas Arlington leverage the chemical reactivity and mechanical strength of graphene with the separation capabilities of organic ligands (e.g. Diglycolamides) to design innovative hybrid nanomaterials that effectively extract RE metals through environmentally sustainable processes. The researchers? synergistic activities combine theoretical modeling efforts with synthetic chemistry and analytical characterization techniques to functionalize various forms of graphene, creating hybrid materials that selectively separate RE metals. Moreover, this project contributes to developing a scientific workforce through the education and training. Undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers, learn to tackle complex technological challenges preparing them for their future careers in STEM. Ultimately, this project will deliver fundamental chemical insights and engineering applications for novel RE metal separation to promote US autonomy for these critical resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This S-STEM Research Hub will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need. Across the past decade, 40%-50% of college students in the United States each year started their postsecondary education at a two-year college. Students enrolled at two-year colleges are more likely to be low-income and from historically underrepresented groups, compared to students who start postsecondary education enrolled in four-year colleges. Led by a collaborative team of universities and community colleges representing 9 current NSF S-STEM projects, the PROSPECT S-STEM research hub will explore how equitable partnerships between two-year colleges and four-year institutions can empower low-income STEM transfer students. Researchers at Clemson University, East Carolina University, Southeast Community College, the University of Missouri-Kansas City, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Augsburg University, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the University of Texas at Arlington, and YNOTI Solutions along with 14 two-year college partners are united by their goal to support domestic, low-income undergraduates as they navigate the transfer process. Numerous challenges exist that can make it difficult for students to successfully transfer from two- and four-year colleges, which in turn can reduce the likelihood that these students earn a bachelor?s degree. This project will address this issue by collecting and analyzing national-level data to highlight transfer issues. The hub?s research will support the development of strategies and resources to build institutional partnerships designed to increase positive outcomes for low-income transfer students. <br/><br/>The PROSPECT S-STEM Hub will operate as a research and dissemination hub to investigate the nature of two- and four-year colleges? partnerships and how developing co-equitable partnerships can better support low-income STEM scholars before and after the transition process. There is a need to understand how two- and four-year colleges can effectively establish and maintain partnerships. Equitable partnerships that support transfer students necessarily involve a range of stakeholders across institutions. PROSPECT S-STEM will examine the nature of these partnerships through: a) longitudinal case studies of two- and four-year college partnerships trying to improve STEM transfer student success; and b) the establishments of professional learning communities with key stakeholders, including advisors, faculty, financial aid, student affairs professionals, and other administrators involved with transfer policies and programs. Our investigation of these partnerships is framed through the lens of community cultural wealth, partnership capital, and dimension of equity. The mixed methods research will include interviews, participant concept mapping, document analysis, and survey data from S-STEM Scholars. PROSPECT S-STEM will target dissemination to researchers, advisors, student affairs professionals, administrators and other stakeholders who support STEM transfer students, thus facilitating the scale up of this project?s practices and findings to others seeking to support low-income STEM transfer students. This hub is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The project aims to develop an enhanced open networked airborne computing platform to facilitate the design, implementation, and testing of an airborne computing platform that seamlessly integrates control, computing, communication, and networking. The project will provide community support based on the flywheel model, and to attract and engage community users through organized support from four regional sites in the nation, hands-on workshops, testbed access, and technical user services. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit lies in a new set of enhancements to facilitate more advanced research and applications of airborne computing. Specifically, the proposed infrastructure is enhanced in four major areas. First, hardware/middle-ware update to facilitate distributed control, which includes phased array antennas, next generation of mobile system, and Robot Operating System (ROS) 2. Second, enhancement of communication and networking, which include software-defined radio (SDR), long-term evolution (LTE), and software-defined networking (SDN). Third, enhancement of airborne computing services, which include the target recognition and tracking service, mobile edge computing (MEC) service, and airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data processing service. Last, the incorporation of security features, which include the development of a secure and privacy-preserving federated learning platform and integration of security packages to fulfill essential and advanced security requirements, such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and secure computation.<br/><br/>This collaborative project brings together investigators from the University of North Texas (UNT), the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), San Diego State University (SDSU), and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez (UPRM). All four participating universities are minority-serving (UPRM) or Hispanic-serving (UTA, UNT, and SDSU) institutions with a large number of underrepresented minority students. The project will reach out to local communities through K-12 activities, and also pursue broad dissemination through organizing student design competitions, tutorials, and workshops, participating in national demonstration efforts, and engaging domain professionals. The proposed education and outreach activities will produce a profound impact on broad communities and benefit a large number of underrepresented minority students. The proposed project on enhanced open networked airborne computing platform will address the design and evaluation needs of many researchers in the CISE community and benefit a wide range of applications in the emergency, energy, environment, and transportation sectors.<br/><br/>The project website https://utari.uta.edu/research/airborne/ will be the portal to access detailed design documents, hardware and software tools, tutorial, datasets, training materials, conferences and workshops, and other project-related materials to extend the research capabilities of the broader community during and beyond the project span.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Fundamental knowledge of protein structures and their dynamic responses to stimuli or other molecules is important for many applications, including medical diagnosis and therapy.  This research aims to develop a highly sensitive approach for studying the human serum transferrin protein (hSTf), which is a vital iron carrier in blood and of clinical importance.  The sensing technique would allow differentiation of the free hSTf protein from the iron-bound protein and evaluation of iron deficiency or iron overload from very small blood samples.  Successful development of this sensor would also enable profiling of a wide range of other proteins and biological molecules, e.g., DNA.  This project offers excellent opportunities for interdisciplinary research training as it combines biochemistry, nanoengineering, photonics, and electrical engineering.  The outreach efforts to K-12 schools through various programs at the Southern Methodist University and  the University of Texas at Arlington help to inspire more students to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degrees.<br/><br/>The stacked plasmonic nanosensor is based on the self-induced back-action (SIBA) actuated nanopore electrophoresis (SANE) sensing concept.  The stacked nanopores are uniquely designed to enable 1) controlled trapping, releasing, and recapturing of proteins or the substrate-bound protein complexes, 2) transient deformation of the biological molecules, which can be induced by thermal effect or a combination of optical and electrical techniques, and 3) study of their deformation dynamics.  The SANE concept implemented in the stacked nanopore sensor allows investigation of protein interactions at concentrations 1000-fold below the equilibrium dissociation constant in bulk solution, making this technique ultra-sensitive.  An important aim of this research is the study of the properties of free-hSTf protein and the iron-bound protein complex using the SANE sensor.  Optical signature profiles are established for each of the species to enable selective admission of bound complexes over unbound proteins in a mixed solution to the underlying pore. It uses symmetric (VCapture = VRecapture), followed by asymmetric (VCapture ? VRecapture) voltage conditions to facilitate the investigation of the strength and kinetic parameters associated with protein-substrate binding, protein relaxation times, and whether voltage-induced protein unfolding is reversible or not.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Microsevice architecture typically yields highly scalable, maintainable, testable and loosely coupled systems. For this reason, cloud-computing services are shifting from traditional monolithic architectures to microservice architectures to enable fast development, easy debugging and frequent software updating. A primary  design goal of cloud computing is to provide user-centric services that meet diverse end-to-end application query tail-latency Service Level Objective (SLO) requirements, while maximizing system-resource utilization. This proposal aims at developing such an approach, known as Distributed scalable  End-to-end Tail lAtency SLO Guaranteed rEsource Management framework for microservices (DETAGEM). DETAGEM explores foundational principles to establish a solid theoretical foundation towards a comprehensive solution for resource allocation with guaranteed per-query tail-latency SLO.   The algorithms and tools developed in DETAGEM will be made available to benefit a broad set of researchers, engineers and educators, and thereby advancing research across a range of other areas. Moreover, the obtained results from this project will be integrated into existing undergraduate and graduate curricula on a continuous basis. The involvement of underrepresented students in this proposed research at The University of Texas at Arlington will enhance their competitiveness in the future job market.<br/><br/>DETAGEM is a comprehensive distributed scalable solution rooted in fundamental principles. The approach taken by DETAGEM is to (a) derive a mathematical foundation that maps the SLO for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) workflows for queries to the task queuing budgets for tasks in the queies at their respective microservices, based on the statistics of unloaded task response time measured at individual microservices at runtime; and (b) develop task-queuing-budget-aware queue-management schemes and resource-auto-scaling schemes based on measured task-queuing budget-violation ratios.  The objective is to ensure that all the microservices meet their respective task-queuing budgets, which will then guarantee that the end-to-end query tail-latency SLO for the queries are satisfied. The successful completion of the proposed project is expected to greatly advance the state-of-the-art in terms of methodologies, theories, and practical solutions for the microservice architecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Non-technical Summary<br/><br/>Bacteria can infect all body parts, including those with pH values below neutral, such as the urinary tract, oral cavity, respiratory epithelia, skin, and other soft tissues. While many antimicrobial agents have optimal bactericidal activity at a neutral pH, the unusual acidic pH can impair the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of pharmaceutical drugs and promote bacterial resistance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as an alternative solution to conventional antibiotics to address the global problem of infectious diseases due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and less tendency for bacteria to develop resistance. Although AMPs are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics, their widespread use and translation into clinical application is hampered by several intrinsic limitations, including their susceptibility to proteases and moderate to severe toxicity towards host cells. It is generally believed that new design and engineering strategy is needed to overcome the intrinsic limitation of traditional AMPs for targeted antimicrobial therapy. The PI?s group recently developed a technology platform of self-assembling antimicrobial nanofibers (SAANs) to circumvent the shortcomings of both traditional antibiotics and AMPs. SAANs are supramolecular assemblies of multidomain peptides (MDPs) that can undergo programmed self-assembly into nanostructured filaments. While killing broad-spectrum antibiotic-resistant bacteria, SAANs offer key advantages over traditional single chain AMPs in terms of improved stability, precisely controlled AMP loading capacity, minimal cytotoxicity and greatly improved hemocompatibility. More recently, the PI?s group advance the fundamental design principles to develop a novel acid-activatable SAANs using pH-responsive MDPs as the molecular building block. The long-term goal is to apply SAANs as stable systemic nanocarriers for targeted AMP delivery. The research objectives of the present proposal are to expand the family of SAANs containing pH-responsive non-natural amino acids to further modulate materials stability and activity, and to develop more potent pH-dependent multicomponent SAANs with synergistic antimicrobial effect to eradicate bacteria at their preferred acidic environment without affecting healthy tissues and cells. At the University of Texas at Arlington which is a Hispanic-serving institution, the PI contributes to education of increased diversity in STEM fields, particularly encouraging research participation from underrepresented students with weakly performing academic record along with her other outreach and education efforts. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The NSF project is focused on the synthesis and self-assembly of pH-responsive peptides with non-natural amino acids that show triggered antimicrobial activity in the weakly acidic pH range.  The project is driven by our recent discovery of Acid-Activatable Self-Assembled Antimicrobial Nanofibers (AA-SAANs), which is generated through the self-assembly of pH-responsive multidomain peptides (MDPs). The MDPs are assembled into nanofibers at the physiological condition and being inactive. At the acidic infection site where the local pH decreases, AA-SAANs are triggered to dissemble and release the activated MDPs to interact with the bacterial cell membrane and kill bacteria. In this proposal we will validate and advance the fundamental design principle by using MDPs with expanded chemistry to develop more potent AA-SAANs. The research objectives of this proposal are: 1) Establish AA-SAANs using new pH-responsive MDPs containing non-natural ionic amino acids; 2) Fabrication and evaluation of multicomponent AA-SAANs with synergistic antimicrobial activity; 3) Evaluate the pH-dependent biological activity of these materials in vitro. These efforts will provide critical insight into the fundamental molecular and supramolecular chemistry that govern the structure and antimicrobial activity of AA-SAANs. Further, this strategy is highly transformative for the rational design and synthesis of functional materials with built-in pH-responsive properties to probe various complex biological processes in which pH gradient plays an important role.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "WIth support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism-B (CSDM-B) program, Professor Sherri McFarland at the University of Texas, Arlington will interrogate how molecular  conformation, ionizability, and intermolecular interactions influence the behavior of photosensitizers, particularly oligothiophene-containing ruthenium compounds. Photosensitizers are compounds that harness the light energy to facilitate a desirable physical process or chemical transformation. Such molecules have utility in fields spanning solar energy conversion to chemical catalysis, and also photomedicine. This project focuses on a photosensitizer class that shows promise for cancer therapy and may follow a unique type of multimodal action that combines photocatalysis and intermolecular photochemical reactions with singlet oxygen sensitization. The project will use the tools of coordination chemistry plus photophysical and electrochemical techniques to explore the roles of isomerism, agglomeration and confinement, and environment on these pathways. The proposed work will train graduate students and undergraduates in highly multidisciplinary research at the nexus of chemistry, biology, physics, and engineering. This multifaceted training in synthesis, inorganic photophysics and spectroscopy, and electrochemistry will help to prepare the future workforce in science and technology. The broader impact objectives are aimed at improving scientific literacy and addressing educational equity in research. The McFarland team is particularly focused on addressing educational equity issues in undergraduate research and improving scientific literacy using bench-to-bedside projects with societal impact through curriculum-based research experiences (CUREs) for undergraduate STEM students. The project aims to equip tomorrow?s leaders with skills in science communication and expose them to entrepreneurship as it relates to bringing scientific discoveries from the laboratory to society.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Sherri McFarland and her team will examine the redox and excited state properties of oligothiophene-containing Ru(II) complexes, compounds that have important applications as photosensitizers in fields ranging from solar energy conversion to photomedicine. Imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline (IP) ligands appended to oligothiophenes (nT) of sufficient chain length n adopt planarized lowest-energy triplet states that are of significant intraligand charge transfer (ILCT) character. Oligothiophenes are redox active, and the neighboring IP group may enable proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) to facilitate catalytic photoredox reactions from the 3ILCT states. These charge-separated excited states may also undergo chemical dimerization and generate singlet oxygen. The project aims to develop a photophysical model for these systems in simple solvents and in complex biological environments. Each system will be studied from the point of view of molecular structure, redox chemistry and photophysics, with longer term implications for phototherapy mechanisms. The UTA team will synthesize and characterize oligothiophene-appended Ru(II) complexes, [Ru(LL)2(IP-nT)]2+, to probe the effects of various factors on the proposed PCET-facilitated pathways: ionization state, excited state conformation, triplet energy and character, and bimolecular processes. Synthetic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical techniques will be used to test the importance of nT-based triplets with CT character and ionizable groups for multimodal action and probe how the excited state dynamics are influenced at biological interfaces based on factors such as ionization, conformation, and isomerism.  This project aims to advance the fields of coordination chemistry, photochemistry and photophysics, and ultimately photomedicine, in the longer term.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports integrated research, educational, and outreach efforts on understanding and designing high performance memristors as potential device candidates for next generation data-centric computing applications. Memristor is a type of material device that can change its resistance states under external fields and maintain such changes via the formation and evolution of electrically conductive channels in the host materials. However, high-performance memristors that exhibit low-energy and gradual resistive switching, good retention, and uniformity in switching in a single device have not yet materialized. In this project, the PI and his team aim to develop a computational framework to elucidate the key factors of materials used in memristors as well as the roles of ion migration, electrochemical reaction, surface energy, and mechanical strain that can potentially be tuned to enable low-current and gradual switching. Based on this, the PI will identify new mobile species/host materials and predict microstructures that can achieve gradual, uniform, and stable switching performances. These performances are key to memristors used for accurate and efficient neural network training and analog computing. Knowledge obtained from this study will provide guidance to the experimental synthesis, characterization, and testing of novel memristors, which will be used to further benchmark the computational approach. <br/><br/>To integrate the educational and outreach activities with the research works, the PI will compile the developed computational tools into a user-interface software and disseminate it to the broader research community. The project will encourage underrepresented minorities, especially Hispanic and first-generation college students in the Dallas?Fort Worth area, to pursue science and engineering related projects through the proposed ?Mentor?Mentee? program.

Memristors, which can change their electrical resistance and maintain such changes, enable in-memory computing, making them promising candidates for next-generation data-centric computing applications, such as nonvolatile memory, neural network training, and analog computing etc. However, high-performance memristors that exhibit low-energy and gradual resistive switching, good retention, and uniformity in switching have not yet been achieved, and the mechanisms that underpin these switching behaviors are not fully understood. The main objective of this research is to establish accurate theories and advance the knowledge of the mechanism of these highly desirable resistive switching, and to identify potential mobile species and host materials that enable these needed performances which are unachievable with existing memristors. It is hypothesized that the interactions among reduction-oxidation reaction, charge transport, and interfacial and strain effects result in a dynamic free energy landscape of the memristor system, which can be engineered by selecting proper mobile species and designing the microstructure of the switching layer to achieve needed switching performance. This project will integrate the experiment-validated phase-field model to understand both gradual and sudden switching dynamics driven by the chemical, electrical, interfacial, and mechanical energy competitions, the high-throughput calculations and machine learning to identify new mobile species/host materials, and the combined atomistic and mesoscale modeling of the microstructure of the host material and its effect on the stability and uniformity of resistive switching. Knowledge obtained from this theoretical study will guide experimental synthesis, characterization, and measurement of the novel memristors, which will be used to further benchmark and complement the simulation work. <br/><br/>To integrate the educational and outreach activities with the research works, the PI will compile the developed computational tools into a user-interface software and disseminate it to the broader research community.

Trace chemical analysis often requires that a sample be prepared beforehand to selectively extract a certain class of compounds or to reduce interferences.  Manual sample preparation is common, but can introduce error relative to an automated approach.  The Schug group focuses on an automated on-line sample preparation and chemical analysis platform utilizing powerful methods known as supercritical fluid extraction and chromatography.  This analytical system is very broadly applicable to the measurement of a wide variety of chemical compounds. However, there are many variables that need to be optimized, and their combined effect on the outcome of the measurement is difficult to rationalize.  To address this challenge, the team is developing a machine learning-based surrogate optimization procedure to efficiently explore optimal conditions. The results of the surrogate optimization runs will be modeled using novel multi-task learning for ?small data,? so as to provide general knowledge for approximating optimal instrumentation conditions. The graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will gain complementary experience in advanced data handling and analytical measurements.  Results of the work will be widely disseminated at local, regional, and national conferences, and in peer-reviewed publications.<br/><br/>Online supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) coupled with supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) offers automated sample preparation and chemical analysis over a very broad application space.  The team is integrating statistics, machine learning, and operations research to enable SFE-SFC method development. SFE-SFC, especially combined with mass spectrometry (MS) detection, has near-universal capabilities for comprehensive analysis of small molecules contained in solid samples. In pursuit of these aims, the team is (1) exploring innovative representations for input features such as sample material, analyte, and SFC column chemistry; (2) developing new experimental design (DoE) processes over the input feature space and over the experimental parameter space that comply with the constraints of the SFE-SFC system;  (3) implementing the DoE process within a rigorous multiple-objective surrogate optimization that incorporates provably-optimal techniques from mixed integer linear and quadratic programming; and (4) deriving \"small data\" multi-task learning algorithms integrating nonparametric Bayesian modeling with Gaussian processes to construct a flexible multi-response predictive model for the optimized parameters over the input feature space.  SFE-SFC has the potential to supplant other methods that are off-line, less efficient, and less ?green.?  This research aims to vastly reduce the future burden for those who implement SFE-SFC.  Further, the developed DoE, machine learning, and surrogate optimization methodologies for \"small data\" will be generally applicable and available for a wide range of societal challenges in domains such as healthcare and ?green? building, for which the sample of patients or buildings is typically limited.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(Sandy) Dasgupta and his students at the University of Texas at Arlington are working to improve the performance and portability of a family of important instruments known as chromatographs.  These instruments are widely used for separating the constituents of complex mixtures, enabling further analysis of the separated components.  The underlying science of chromatography is critical for applications such as assuring the purity of reagents used in the semiconductor industry; environmental analysis (including monitoring reactive pollutants that cannot survive a long trip to the lab); monitoring water disinfection byproducts; manufacturing pharmaceuticals; and monitoring food safety. The Dasgupta group is working to make such instruments easily field-portable (small, lightweight, low-power, and low-cost) without compromising their separation capabilities.  The aim is on-site measurement in such contexts as a physician?s office or patient's bedside; industrial troubleshooting; and water-monitoring in submarines and even in the international space station. Through involvement of students ranging from junior- and senior-level high school interns through postdoctoral fellows, Professor Dasgupta is also addressing the high demand for people trained to use these techniques.  As he develops new instruments and techniques, he is incorporating them into laboratory curricula and working with instrument-makers for commercialization.<br/><br/>The Dasgupta group is using moldable ion-exchange polymers developed in the previous NSF-funded project to make ion transport-driven nonmechanical nL/min - uL/min pumps and molded microchannels to provide ultra-miniature suppressors and eluent generators. Open-channel columns with helical and 2D/3D serpentine geometries are being systematically investigated for their separations capabilities.  These columns can be fabricated by 3D printing and near-IR laser machining, making them inexpensive and amenable to mass production. The team is exploring direct photothermal and multireflection absorption measurements for sensitive detection, as well as computational techniques to reduce dispersion. Finally, they are exploring the use of porous tubes (where radial flow is induced by evaporation) and pressure-driven axial flow in the presence of a transverse, time-dependent, electric field as approaches to achieving the high separation efficiencies characteristic of microchannels while operating at higher flow rates, so that extra-column dispersion requirements are lessened.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Significant post-disaster cost escalations often slow down repair process, magnify inequality, and amplify underinsurance problem. This research will reveal vulnerable characteristics in regional housing construction markets and identify effective disaster-related policies to alleviate these vulnerabilities. It will help identify the construction capacity gaps that cause the construction cost escalation following natural disasters. The discovery is critical for raising awareness, developing a greater construction capacity, setting effective reconstruction goals, initiating risk mitigation and resourcing strategies, and enforcing effective regulations and policies. Cutting the housing recovery time and cost through effective pre-planning could be realized. This project also aims to address the critical shortage of talents capable of leading post-disaster reconstruction in the civil engineering discipline. Hispanics and women graduate and undergraduate students at the Hispanic-serving University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) will participate in every step of this project. This project will enable students to work with city planners to lead stakeholder involvement in disadvantaged communities.<br/><br/>This project will address fundamental limitations of existing demand surge models by 1) creating non-hazard econometric baselines for housing construction cost variations, 2) creating an econometric measurement method for quantifying post-disaster construction cost escalations, 3) creating spatiotemporal econometric models to represent the housing reconstruction demand surge, and assessing the housing reconstruction vulnerability of communities, and 4) quantifying the impacts of disaster-related policies on housing reconstruction. This project will generate new knowledge at the nexus of three critical disciplines: Housing Construction, Economics, and Built Environment Resilience. The research will transform existing construction demand surge models by establishing links between pre-disaster construction market conditions and post-disaster construction cost escalations. To that end, spatiotemporal econometric models, such as spatial panel data models, will use data from more than 600 U.S. counties affected by large-scale natural disasters over the past ten years, as well as data from their neighboring counties. These models will consider different circumstances based on a range of non-hazard to extreme hazard conditions. Difference-in-difference panel data models will estimate the effect of disaster-related policies (ranging from local to federal). The research team will engage federal, state, and local governments to identify and evaluate various disaster-related policies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Important chemical feedstocks include a group of molecules called alkenes, molecules that contain carbon-carbon double bonds. The alkenes are used in the manufacture of many important plastics and include ethylene, which is used to make polyethylene; propylene, which is used to make polypropylene; and a several others. The alkenes are produced during the refining of crude oil. However, they are always obtained as complex mixtures of alkenes and other petroleum components. In order to obtain pure alkenes, crude oil mixtures are separated using an energy-intensive distillation process. Presently, ethylene and propylene purification alone accounts for about 0.3% of the world?s total energy consumption. A more a efficient separation technique for alkenes would be of great benefit. Toward this end, Dr. Rasika Dias, University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), is supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program to develop metal compounds that are capable of separating alkenes at room temperature and pressure. The general method prepares copper compounds that bind specific alkenes and can be induced to release the alkene in a targeted way. This behavior may be used for the low energy purification of alkenes. As an ancillary effort, the copper and related silver compounds are modified to detect alkenes. This is important not only to monitor industrial environments, but also to a number of fruit and flower industries as ethylene induces the ripening of fruit (such as bananas)and the degradation of flowers. This project integrates research into the educational experience for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and prepares them for productive careers physical science. Professor Dias plans to recruit students from traditionally underrepresented groups including McNair and LSAMP programs, offering research opportunities in his laboratory. High-school and Community College student mentoring activities are also planned. Professor Dias organizes a symposium at UTA inviting Assistant Professors and Postdoctoral Fellows to meet and share their research findings.  He also organizes a workshop on X-ray crystallography to benefit area crystallographers and utilizes the UTA Planetarium facilities to educate and excite young audiences (including pre-K) in science.<br/><br/>In this project, copper and silver complexes of multi-dentate pyrazolate ligands are synthesized and their abilities to selectively and reversibly bind ethylene, propylene, and butane are evaluated. A systematic study is undertaken to discern how the overall heat of the olefin-binding can be managed through modification of the supporting ligands.  The goal of this research is to design compounds that facilitate olefin-paraffin separations.  A second focus concentrates on the development of sensors to detect ethylene.  In this effort, a family of luminescent copper and silver pyrazolate complexes that produce optical signals upon exposure to olefins are prepared.  Overall, the project investigates the structure, bonding, and reactivity of late d-block complexes with labile metal-ligand interactions.  Students contributing to this project will gain valuable experience in synthesis, modern characterization techniques, and critical thinking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Neutron stars (NS) are the most compact known stellar objects, apart from black holes.  When a neutron star is in a binary orbit with another star, and material flows from the star to the neutron star, the NS can undergo an explosive outburst, which often includes the emission of X rays.  Type I X-ray bursts are powered by unstable thermonuclear burning of freshly accreted hydrogen- and/or helium-rich material on the surface of a NS in a low-mass X-ray binary.   About 20% of bursts are photospheric radius expansion (PRE) bursts, in which the luminosity of the burst is so high that radiation forces drive an optically thick wind that lifts the photosphere (outer shell from which light is radiated) off the NS surface.   A research collaboration between the University of Virginia (UVa) and the University of Texas at Arlington will study the physics of PRE X-ray bursts, using a combination of sophisticated computer models to simulate X-ray bursts in 1D spherical symmetry and 2D axisymmetery, both in the Newtonian and general relativistic limits.   They will compare the results of their simulations directly with observations.  This work will allow astronomers to better understand neutron stars, how they interact with matter, and what is the balance of pressure, volume and temperature within neutron stars.  The project will also facilitate STEM research among a number of groups. Two graduate students will be given training in state-of-the-art computational tools. The PIs will incorporate the research into their mentoring of undergraduate researchers from underrepresented groups in STEM fields through one principle investigator?s participation in the VA-NC alliance and Spelman College-UVa Exchange summer research programs and the other?s participation in the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Summer Research Academy. The investigators will also draw on the research as part of their public outreach efforts. <br/><br/>The proposed research would leverage state-of-the-art numerical simulation tools, combining MESA and Athena++ codes, to provide the most sophisticated simulation of PRE bursts to date. This includes generation of synthetic spectra at different points in the burst to calibrate assumptions commonly used to infer neutron star masses and radii from burst observations. This work is timely due to the wealth of new observations from NASA?s NICER mission, which provide better spectral coverage for later stages of burst evolution and have identified spectral lines in the burst spectra. Spectral modelling will be able to characterize constraints from continuum emission but also aid in the interpretation of these spectral features. These would be among the first calculations to self-consistently solve for the time-dependent solution in full general relativity while exploring the possible inclination dependence through non-spherical calculations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). <br/><br/>Esophageal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the USA, with a poor survival rate. Late diagnosis is a primary reason for this since esophageal cancer does not present early symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop fast and effective targeted therapies for esophageal cancer, improving drug tolerance and clinical outcomes. Evidence from limited clinical studies has shown that cell signaling pathways present significantly altered genetic expressions in esophageal cancer cells and have been found to correlate with poor prognosis and disease progression. Moreover, compared with other solid tumor malignancies, esophageal cancer presents many more stochastic heterogeneities and diverse origins, which have been found to be major factors of drug resistance. Thus, due to the cost and time limitations of clinical trials, it is of paramount importance to develop computational frameworks that can accurately represent the stochastic behavior of signaling pathways and provide a rapid and cost-effective evaluation of combination therapies to control esophageal cancer. This project aims to elucidate the aforementioned questions by new mathematical modeling of the dynamical behavior of a class of signaling pathways in esophageal cancer and associated treatment strategies. The framework can also be adapted for the rapid evaluation of treatments in other cancer types and chronic diseases. The project will be conducted at the University of Texas at Arlington, a Hispanic-Serving institution. The project will bolster students from underrepresented groups in research and provide training opportunities through project-based learning modules and a new graduate course in computational mathematical biology. Finally, this project will lay the foundation for the investigator's long-term goal to develop a Center for Integrative Math-Bio and Experimental Research (CIMBEX). The center will promote integrative mathematical biology and experimental research environment for students from underrepresented groups and bolster student retention in STEM.<br/> <br/>This project aims to define and validate a novel stochastic mathematical framework for analyzing and controlling the dynamical behavior of a key stochastic signaling pathway in esophageal cancer, known as epidermal growth factor receptor, for a better understanding of associated monitoring and treatment strategies. The specific research objectives are to (1) develop and analyze a controlled hybrid switching diffusion process, in a Fokker-Planck setting, that accounts for heterogeneity-induced stochasticity in the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway dynamics, and (2) build a new gradient-free optimal control algorithm, based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, that provides qualitatively accurate and computationally efficient numerical simulations of treatment outcomes using combination therapies, validated by esophageal cancer signaling data from laboratory experiments. The outcomes of this project will be the development of a new modeling and control framework for dynamical processes, the promotion of interdisciplinary research with biologists, and research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups. While the focus is on cancer mechanisms, the project aims to define a mathematical framework that applies equally well to other chronic diseases, where stochasticity plays an important role.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism-B program is supporting the research of Professor Sherri McFarland at the University of Texas, Arlington to  examine the excited state photophysics and redox properties of Ru-based photosensitizers. Photosensitizers are compounds that can trap the energy of light and use it to effect a useful chemical reaction. Examples of this include solar energy conversion, catalysis, and photodrugs. This project focuses on a particular class of such photosensitizers that show promise in cancer therapy, but have many unanswered questions about their mode of action. The work will investigate the fundamental photophysical and electrochemical properties of oligothiophene-containing ruthenium compounds specifically, and reveal the details of photocatalytic mechanisms in which they can participate. It will also explore how the behavior of these photosensitizers can change as a function of its environment, e.g., agglomeration effects and the influence of simulated biological structures. The proposed work will train graduate and undergraduate students in highly multidisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry, biology, physics, and engineering. The knowledge and skills these trainees will acquire will give them tools necessary for success as future research scientists in cutting-edge multidisciplinary fields ranging from photomedicine to solar energy conversion and chemical biology. The broader impact objectives will simultaneously equip tomorrow?s leaders with skills in science communication and expose them to entrepreneurship and commercialization as it relates to bringing scientific discoveries from the laboratory to society. It will also provide curriculum-based research opportunities for undergraduate students that would otherwise not have the opportunity to experience scientific research in a real-world laboratory setting, expanding diversity in our next generation of emerging scientists.<br/><br/>This project project will examine the excited state photophysics and redox properties of oligothiophene-containing Ru(II) complexes, compounds that have important applications as photosensitizers in fields ranging from solar energy conversion to photodrugs.  The project also aims to develop the photophysical model(s) for these photosensitizers in complex biological environments. We will synthesize and characterize oligothiophene-appended Ru(II) photosensitizers, [Ru(LL)2(IP-nT)]2+ that differ in the number of thiophene rings (nT), the types of substituents on the thiophene rings, and the co-ligands (LL). The modifications are designed to systematically vary redox potentials and triplet state characteristics, and to alter the covalent and noncovalent associations typical of oligothiophenes. Electrochemical and photophysical techniques will be used to test hypothetical photoredox catalysis mechanisms in complex substrates, where synthetic and cell-derived vesicles will be used to model how photosensitizer response modulates in confined matrices, e.g., a lipid bilayer. The results will advance the field of Ru(II)-oligothiophene photosensitization. With a mechanistic understanding of oligothiophene-containing Ru(II) photosensitizers, there exists the opportunity to create better next-generation photosensitizers for photocatalytic applications. The broader impact activities are equally focused on exposing STEM scientists to science communication and entrepreneurship based on past translational research and commercialization efforts related to light-molecule interactions. The training program will cover outreach, education, and curriculum, emphasizing the process from fundamental discovery to societal application, and provide opportunities for researchers to improve their science communication skills. Curriculum-based research opportunities for undergraduate STEM students will be designed and delivered to ensure that a larger percentage of these students receive hands-on research experience during their degree programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but play important regulatory roles in various biological and cellular processes such as cancer metastasis, therapeutic targets, immune responses, chromatin remodeling, and embryonic development. Despite exciting findings in recent years, the functions of most lncRNAs remain largely unknown as they are often transcribed from non-coding regions of the genome. Their functions are not always clear and lack conservation across species.  The project aims to develop an efficient graph neural network method called Layer-stacked ATTention Embedding to Gene Ontology (LATTE2GO) to reliably annotate lncRNA functions describing each with various gene ontology features including molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. Research activities will engage minorities, women, and undergraduates performing interdisciplinary research through the Girl Engineering Summer Camp, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation Summer Research Academy, and the McNair programs at the University of Texas at Arlington. <br/><br/>The research will aggregate gene ontology structure and multiple interactions between genes, transcripts, and proteins as a knowledge graph containing heterogeneous relationships. The project will (1) extract higher-order multi-omics interrelations from heterogenous interactions as well as multi-relational associations; (2) develop representation learning of lncRNA functions from multiple relationships in the hierarchical gene ontology within the same message-passing framework; and (3) explore attention graph neural networks to effectively aggregate heterogeneous interactions and gene ontology term pertinencies.  By extracting higher-order associations and weighting them via attention, LATTE2GO aims to achieve significant gains over previous graph-based function prediction techniques. In addition, the architecture has the advantage of learning features directly from complete hierarchical ontology and connecting with lncRNA network relations in an end-to-end manner. The novel framework could be extended to integrating multiple heterogeneous data sources for generic computational and data science problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Charles P. Shelor and his students from the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) intend to build a portable instrument for measuring poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the field. PFAS are a class man-made chemicals utilized in fire-fighting foams and cleaning products.  PFAS have often been referred to as ?forever? chemicals due to their environmental stability. As such, they accumulate in the environment and pose a challenge for generations to come. In addition, some types of PFAS may pose significant  health risks. Typically, PFAS are measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), a highly sophisticated and expensive instrument. Due to the high cost of capital equipment and the cost per analysis, the extent of contamination of rural and less affluent communities is often unknown. Further, heavily affected areas such as industrial centers, landfills, etc. disproportionately affect marginalized communities. This project aims to develop an inexpensive instrument capable of reliably measuring total organic fluorine that would serve as a scouting surrogate for PFAS, such that detailed analyses could an be carried by the latter when warranted. The size and weight of the envisioned instrument makes it well suited for tracking contamination plumes in the field enabling real time decisions and source attribution. By rapidly identifying the extent of the problem, remediation measures towards protecting public health would be facilitated.<br/><br/>The instrument being developed first selectively concentrates PFAS from water on a filter. The project intends to develop and functionalize the filter media. The PFAS on the filter will be mineralized using a focused plasma produced by discharge. The plasma generates energetic species to break down PFAS compounds. The digest solution then passes through miniature solid phase extraction cartridge which has high affinity for fluoride. Separation is then performed on either a miniaturized packed capillary ion chromatograph or open tubular ion chromatograph (OTIC). While the packed capillary system uses commercially available components, the OTIC system is expected to offer an approximately 100-fold improvement in sensitivity. Additionally, the OTIC is more portable due to the lower weight and reduced power requirements. If successful, development and deployment of this instrument is expected to make a significant impact on data acquisition for PFAS, particularly in isolated or in rural areas around the country.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This project aims to construct a Soil Organic Carbon Knowledge Graph (SOCKG) to address the demand for accurate soil carbon data. Accurate soil carbon data is essential for quantifying carbon credits and encouraging sustainable farming practices that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The developed knowledge graph will support better policy decisions, enhanced carbon valuation accuracy, risk reduction, and increased financial gains from soil carbon management and participation in carbon markets. The collaboration between the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) and the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) include the UTA leading technical development with their expertise in data management, data science, and semantic technologies, while the USDA-ARS providing domain knowledge and strategic guidance to ensure real-world applicability and policy impact. SOCKG equips policymakers, land administrators, environmental NGOs, advocacy groups, educators, and realtors with precise data and insights on soil carbon stocks, fluxes, and dynamics, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding climate change mitigation, policy formulation, land use planning, educational teaching, and real estate development.<br/><br/>Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils is an essential strategy in combating global climate change and an important component of the growing voluntary carbon markets. It offers incentives to farmers to adopt sustainable practices that increase soil carbon levels, thus providing environmental, economic benefits and diversifying their farming ventures. However, the complexity and diversity of soil carbon data, combined with environmental factors and land use, make accurate modeling a challenge. The SOCKG addresses this challenge by amalgamating and aligning different data sources, facilitating wider-scale research and more effective carbon sequestration strategies. By using advanced querying techniques and machine learning models, SOCKG significantly benefits soil carbon researchers, aiding them in predicting soil carbon stocks and addressing the uncertainty in soil organic carbon-related studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The Coastal Bend Region (CBR) of Texas is vulnerable to acute and chronic environmental stressors stemming from natural and industrial sources, including flooding and erosion from high tides, storm surge events, and ship traffic, as well as higher levels of air and water pollution due to expansion of nearby industrial operations. Despite the multitude of environmental hazards facing the region, formal monitoring systems are limited and provide an incomplete view of local-level conditions. In addition, networks for communication and decision-making are often localized and/or fragmented. As a result, CBR communities lack the comprehensive data and decision-making structures needed to plan for, respond to, and mitigate the impacts of potential hazards. This project will advance the understanding of how smart and connected technologies can be integrated into and support regional communication networks to build adaptive capacity in the face of cumulative impacts from climate change and industrial expansion, using the CBR as an exemplar. Research activities will be co-developed and coordinated with residents, community-based organizations, elected officials, and city/county staff to strengthen multidisciplinary, cross-sector partnerships, enhance public engagement with science and technology, and broaden participation by underrepresented groups and frontline communities in the scientific process.<br/><br/>This project will apply a mixed-methods approach to assess how sociotechnical networks can be leveraged to increase knowledge and awareness of environmental and industrial hazards and to build community adaptive capacity equitably among diverse residents of the CBR. This project's main objectives are to (1) evaluate the structure and evolution of regional communication, information-sharing, and policy-making networks focused on environmental change and industrial expansion using grounded theory, (2) develop and leverage real-time sensing technologies, machine learning models, and data dissemination tools to monitor, predict, and communicate local-level environmental conditions, and (3) integrate the social and technical components through usability testing, tabletop exercises, and longitudinal questionnaires to assess how the generated data can be effectively interpreted and presented to various stakeholders to increase knowledge of environmental hazards, strengthen regional decision-making processes, and build adaptive capacity. Community workshops and symposia will provide opportunities to refine the study needs and objectives, obtain feedback on the sensor network and data products, share project results, co-develop a vision for long-term sustainability of the project, and discuss opportunities for integration with other regional efforts.<br/><br/>This project is in response to the Smart & Connected Communities program. It is co-funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "With this Award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Carl Lovely, University of Texas-Arlington to work with undergraduate and graduate students to develop new methods for the construction of complex organic structures, such as those that might used in chemical biology or medicinal chemistry studies. In the present research, new methods and strategies are being invented to allow the assembly of complex molecular frameworks through tandem reactions in order to increase synthetic efficiency.  Tandem reactions involve the sequencing of two or more chemical reactions such that the first reaction sets up the second and so on.  Such strategies have potential to increase efficiency by reducing the number of synthetic steps required in a process, thereby reducing the use of organic solvent and the number of purification steps required.  Plans are outlined to apply the new methodology to the synthesis of two natural products originally isolated from marine invertebrates.  These natural products are of interest due to their unusual bicyclic architectures. These challenging target structures have both inspired the methodology and are seen to have potential for chemical biology studies  Additional benefits which accrue from this project include the recruitment and participation of under-represented high school, undergraduate and graduate students.  In particular, one project has been specifically designed with the participation of high school students in mind.  In this latter context, students have the opportunity to do research in organic synthesis that otherwise would not be available to them.<br/><br/>Professor Lovely and his students develop new methods for the construction of novel heterocyclic molecules using chemistry known as oxidative dearomatizing spiro-cyclization.  In this research, the dearomatization process is linked with a second chemical transformation leading to tandem reaction processes.  Such sequential transformations permit the experimentalist to achieve a rapid increase in molecular complexity in one synthetic operation. Such tactics provide advantages in terms of synthetic efficiency and reduction in the cost of resources.  Specifically, this work examines the oxidative cyclization of guanidines, thioureas, and ureas both in terms of the reaction scope but also to provide a detailed mechanistic understanding of the process.  Two natural products have been identified to test the limits of the proposed chemistry by taking advantage of the efficiency gains.  Both targets are secondary metabolites isolated from marine invertebrates which have yet to succumb to total synthesis efforts and may serve as lead compounds in medicinal chemistry investigations.  The tandem reactions being investigated in the course of this work provide rapid access to the core structural features of these molecules.  Broader impacts of this work include the recruitment and training of the next generation of scientists, including members of groups that are under-represented in the chemical sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This is funding to support a Doctoral Consortium (workshop) of approximately 10 graduate student authors from U.S. institutions of higher learning, along with distinguished research faculty as mentors (who will not be funded by this proposal), to be held in conjunction with the Fifteenth International Conference on Pervasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments (PETRA 2022), which will take place June 29-July 1 on the island of Corfu, Greece.  The PETRA mission is to promote interdisciplinary research on ways to use pervasive ambient intelligent environments to improve the quality of life and enhance human performance with greater capabilities.  It is the only annual conference that brings together theoreticians and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines to focus on the application of pervasive technologies to assistive environments.  Conference outcomes have a broad impact in diverse application areas such as manufacturing, transportation, energy systems, security and safety, robotics, healthcare, biomedicine, environment and conservation.  PETRA brings together very different types of technologies to also address important social and healthcare issues for sensitive populations, such as the elderly, or persons suffering from chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities or traumas.  The PETRA proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library, and the authors of the best papers are invited to submit to special journal issues after the end of the conference.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.petrae.org.  The PETRA 2022 Doctoral Consortium will afford student authors of papers accepted for presentation at the conference a unique opportunity to gain additional exposure for their innovative ideas while also receiving reinforcement for the importance and value of conducting research with societal impact.  The workshop will allow the junior participants to create a social network both among themselves and with senior colleagues. The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to attract participants who are women, members of under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities; to further assure diversity, NSF funds will be used to support no more than 2 student participants from any one institution.  Over the past 14 years, more than 300 graduate and undergraduate students from U.S. educational institutions have been able to benefit from NSF support of the PETRA Doctoral Consortia.<br/><br/>The goals of the Doctoral Consortium, which will consist of special sessions at the beginning, during, and at the end of the conference, are to increase the exposure and visibility of the participants' work within the community, to help establish a sense of community among this next generation of researchers, and to help foster their research efforts by providing substantive feedback and guidance in a supportive and interactive environment from a group of senior researchers.  The special program organized for the students includes sessions between the doctoral students and the faculty mentors, in which the students will discuss their work and ask questions; the faculty mentors will provide constructive comments on the students' work and address their questions.  Each student will be asked to submit a report that provides feedback about the conference, regarding the benefits they received, which presentations they liked and why, and how certain papers and topics relate to their work. After they finish these reports, students will participate in small group breakout sessions to discuss them, and the faculty mentors will provide guidance on how to proceed for further journal publication.  Students will also have the option to submit a poster paper and to attend conference workshops on special topics.  Short papers on the participants' work will be published in the conference proceedings, and a summary report on the event will be posted on the conference website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "As the three-tier IoT-Edge-Cloud hierarchy is evolving into a mature ecosystem in terms of its social and geographical scale, and sensing, computing, and storage capabilities, the cloud is expanding its reach to every corner of the globe. This gives rise to the opportunity of developing a whole new category of cloud services, known as IoT-based Sensing-as-a-Service (ISaaS). With ISaaS, a user would be able to ?sense? any part of the world or even the entire world at his/her fingertip in real time. It is expected that large-scale ISaaS services involving up to billions of edge and IoT devices for simultaneous sensing will emerge as a dominant category of cloud services, in terms of resource demand, and social, economic, and political signi?cance. Notable examples, in decreasing order of time criticality, are earthquake detection and alert, child/patient/object tracking and identification, nation-/world-wide fever/symptom mapping for virus breakout detection, environment and utility monitoring, and crowd sourcing for business analytics. Obviously, to enable such w\u00acide range of ISaaS services with diverse response time requirements, technically known as service level objectives (SLOs), a common orchestration platform that can coordinate resource allocation among and provide an SLO guarantee for such services, encompassing the entire IoT-Edge-Cloud ecosystem, must be in place. This project aims at developing such a platform, called requeST-SLO-aware resource orchestration for large-scale sensing services over IoT-edge-Cloud Hierarchy (STITCH). The approach taken by STITCH promotes fundamental analysis in guiding the design of robust complex systems and provides enablers of new cloud services. It will help foster collaboration between academia and industry in designing e?ective large-scale computing systems. The involvement of underrepresented minority and women students, and students with disability at UTA, a Hispanics Serving Institution, in this research through existing course o?erings and a REU program will help enhance the competitiveness of the future US workforce.<br/><br/>STITCH is a two-level distributed resource orchestration platform, i.e., the cloud-to-edge-cluster level and the edge-cluster-to-edge-and-IoT level.  At the core of STITCH is the development of a novel decomposition technique that can translate a given request SLO into distributed task performance budgets for all the sensing tasks of the request.  More specifically, in the cloud, the decomposition technique translates the request SLO for a given ISaaS service into edge-cluster-level task response-time budgets for the sensing tasks of the request to be dispatched to different edge clusters. In turn, at the edge cluster level, the decomposition technique translates the edge-cluster-level task response-time budgets for each task into task queuing deadlines at individual edge and IoT devices the task is further dispatched to. This solution makes it possible for STITCH to schedule the sensing tasks for sensing in a fully distributed manner, so that it can scale up to billions of edge and IoT devices, while providing request SLO guarantee.  The proposed research addresses key challenges to enable ISaaS services at scale. First, unlike the existing ISaaS orchestration platforms that are mostly resource centric, STITCH is a holistic, user-centric solution that provides SLO guarantee for individual user request of any ISaaS service. Second, unlike the existing solutions where request/job scheduling in the cloud is directly concerned with the edge-and-IoT resource allocation, in STITCH, request scheduling in the cloud is purely driven by the high-level user requirements, leaving the task resource allocation to be handled by the individual edge clusters. This separation of concerns makes the STITCH highly scalable and the autonomous control at the edge possible.  Finally, the approach taken is foundational, applying fundamental principles and mathematical reasoning to address challenges of practical importance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The market for sustainably branded products is part of a massive and rapidly growing industry. In meeting the environmental sustainability demands of the consumer, companies rely on supply chains that may have mitigating labor and environmental implications at the point of origin. This project explores such a supply chain, asking whether consumer demand for products designed to improve sustainability at the point of sale adversely impact sustainability in the communities from which those products originate. The project looks specifically at small-scale extractive contexts, and whether in the aggregate they have consequences for overall measures in environmental and economic sustainability. Data from the study will be disseminated to improve the public's understanding of science and the scientific method, and inform public policies related to mining and commercialization in new markets. The project broadens the participation of groups underrepresented in science and advance scientific education by providing  research opportunities for first-generation minority students at the researcher?s home institution, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).<br/><br/>This study examines the labor-intensive extraction of products that service demands for environmentally sustainable products. It looks specifically at artisanal and small-scale mining contexts, which are major sources of employment in extractive contexts, and have intensified since 2000, but relatively understudied. Social scientists have mainly studied mass-scale industrial extraction of natural resources such as oil and gas while paying less attention to small-scale and more labor-intensive types of mining. The study focuses on three areas: the labor arrangements and working conditions involved in small-scale extractive industries; the strategies used by companies to market those products; and the purposes for which consumers use them. The researcher integrates ethnographic methods including participant-observation, semi-structured interviews, and photo documentation, with quantitative data on mining volumes at extractive sites. The study contributes scientific knowledge on the economic, social, and environmental impacts of natural resource extraction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These proxy data will constrain the extent, timing, pattern and characteristics of the loess; and determine sediment provenance and sediment recycling mechanisms. These proxy data will be integrated with a coupled atmosphere-land model to simulate changes of regional climate and vegetation induced by topography changes, global climate cooling, glaciation and shoreline regression to understand the cause and climate significance of the loess. In additional to gaining fundamental understanding of the loess deposits, the project will shed light on 1) the influence of climate change on biotic evolution at the Eocene-Oligocene transition (~34 million years ago); 2) the validity of different models of surface uplift in the western USA; and 3) the potential positive climate feedback of enhanced mineral dust emissions on global cooling at the transition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Despite continuous efforts and investments to upgrade the networking infrastructure of research and education institutions to meet the needs of large-scale science applications, the data transfers on these networks often perform very poorly. Understanding the underlying reasons for poor transfer performance is important yet challenging due to the sophisticated design of today's cyberinfrastructures. This project offers a set of novel models and algorithms to detect and mitigate performance issues of data transfers in research networks. The proposed suite of tools helps researchers and system administrators to pinpoint the root cause of performance problems of data transfers so that necessary actions can be taken swiftly to minimize their impact on ongoing transfers.  The project will also integrate the research into all levels of education, including science projects with K-12 students, development of new curriculum modules for graduate- and undergraduate-level courses, and summer workshops specifically for minority groups.<br/><br/>Understanding the true underlying reasons for poor transfer performance is key to mitigating them and delivering the promised transfer speeds. However, the involvement of multiple end systems, dynamically changing background traffic, and the complexity of today's networking infrastructures turns it into a complicated and time-consuming process.  This project develops a novel anomaly-detection and performance-optimization framework for end-to-end data transfers at scale. The framework helps to predict, understand, diagnose, and optimize wide-area file transfers in today's extreme-scale cyberinfrastructures. To achieve this goal, it derives deep-neural-network-based predictive models that can relate transfer settings to throughput. These models are then used to estimate the optimal configuration for new transfers. The framework also gathers performance metrics for end-system and network resources periodically to keep track of system utilization. When a transfer anomaly is detected, the collected metrics are fed into anomaly-classification models to identify the root causes. Once the underlying reasons of performance problems are identified, the framework launches a real-time optimization process to reconfigure the transfer settings such that the impact of anomalies can be alleviated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "In arid regions, on Earth and on other planets, wind-blown sand erodes and reshapes landscapes. On human timescales, this erosion can be immeasurably small, so it is unclear how long it takes to form these landscapes. This project will use two recent advances in geochemical measurements to measure erosion rates on southern Californian ventifacts, boulders which are eroded by sand blasting during windstorms. Based on these measurements, this project will investigate whether a past shift in climate produced different ventifact erosion rates. These measurements will also test whether erosion by wind-blown sand depends on rock type or height above the ground surface. Several reference rocks will be manually eroded at a known rate and then measured to test whether the predicted erosion rates based on geochemical measurements match the actual, known erosion rates. Finally, this project will create 3-D digital models of all ten studied ventifacts and make them freely available to educators everywhere with an accompanying teaching module. These boulders are rare and difficult to access, so creating photorealistic educational models dramatically increases access to these fascinating geological features. A limited supply of 3-D printed, handheld models will also be provided at no cost to interested classrooms and printing instructions will be posted online.<br/><br/>The project goal is to quantify the spatial and temporal evolution of aeolian abrasion rates across the surface of ventifacts using recent advances in optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and cosmogenic, in situ 10Be and 14C methods. Rates will be measured on lengths ranging from several mm to tens of cm and timescales from decadal to multi-millennial. This project involves five major research tasks: (1) field campaign to two sites in southern California; (2) in situ cosmogenic 14C-10Be exposure age and erosion rate analysis (1 paired 14C-10Be sample per ventifact, totaling 10); (3) OSL depth profile erosion rate analysis of ventifacts (10 OSL depth profiles per ventifact, totaling 100) and manually eroded rock cylinders (3 erosion rates per lithology and 10 lithologies, totaling 30); (4) generation of digital 3-D models from field photographs of 10 ventifacts using structure-from-motion photogrammetry and handheld educational models from 3-D printing along with an accompanying educational video; and (5) presentation of results at conferences and in peer-reviewed journal articles. Project results will demonstrate, for the first time, that luminescence measurements can accurately recover hard rock erosion rates on a mm-scale. Measured rates will benchmark existing but empirically untested abrasion mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Optical beam steering at high speed is of critical importance for many emerging applications, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, free space communications, 3D sensing and imaging systems. Most existing solutions rely on mechanical movements to steer the light beam direction, which is slow and bulky. The objective of this project is to investigate a fast 2D optical beam steering devices based on the electrical tuning of coupled bi-layer photonic crystal cavities directly integrated on high power vertical cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) arrays. High speed phase tuning can be accomplished with the electrical control of refractive index of the semiconductor material. Leveraging the advances in semiconductor laser technology, integrated photonics technology, and nanophotonics, the proposed solution can result in very compact size, low power consumption, and high reliability. Co-design of nanophotonic cavity with high power VCSEL arrays can provide a disruptive technology for high performance laser detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems. Additionally, the project offers a platform for student education and training, help preparation of diversified workforces in photonics and optics, sensing and imaging, nanotechnology, and manufacturing.<br/><br/>Phase control can be achieved in single and bi-layer coupled photonic crystal slabs. High speed modulation/tuning is feasible with electronic control. Both transmissive and reflective phase tuning elements can be realized with the formation of arrays for high speed spatial light modulators (SLMs) and optical phased arrays (OPAs). The objective here is to investigate some fundamental challenges towards a high scanning speed beam steering OPA structure integrated with high power VCSELs capable of full phase control at 1 GHz speed and above. With this project, various challenges associated with the integrated OPA/VCSEL will be addressed. The integrated modular solution can result in simplified optical design and assembly for compact and reliable LiDAR and beam steering applications. The proposed approach has the following innovative features: (1) High speed: The structure can operate at GHz regime, which will be 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than other approaches based on mechanical scanning technique or conventional spatial light modulator (SLM) technologies. (2) Reliable: The structure is based on co-design and co-packaging of OPAs with VCSELs with simplified optical beam routing schemes and mechanical integration structures.  (3) Scalable: The proposed structure architecture is planar, CMOS compatible, and scalable in 2D, which ensures its manufacturing scalability and device pixel scalability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Quantum information science (QIS) is imperative to economic and national security, commerce, and technology.  Development of a \"quantum smart\" workforce needs to begin before college. The logical venue for exposure to quantum might be a physics course, but numerous K-12 students attend schools where physics is not offered. Since most students will not major in physics, it is vital to expose K-12 students to quantum concepts that are relevant to everyday experiences with credit card security, phones, computers, and basic technology. This project will provide opportunities for students to learn about quantum, regardless of whether they take a physics class. This project will also provide opportunities for secondary educators to learn about QIS and practice teaching it. Project partners include universities, businesses, and professional organizations such as Science Teacher Association in Utah and Texas, American Association of Physics Teachers, Institute for Quantum Computing, and Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. These organizations will provide support for participants and presenters, and provide professional growth opportunities. This project is co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.    <br/><br/>This project aims to impact a minimum of 100 teachers and 600 students. The project will support professional development (PD) for STEM teachers to learn about quantum effects and effective curricular connections through carefully planned resources with learning cycles appropriate for high school students. The first summer will involve virtual PD. The second summer will involve face-to-face (F2F) PD and the third summer will involve F2F local camps. Teachers will co-teach student camps in Year 2 and then provide local camps in year 3.  The camps will provide opportunities for students to learn about quantum mechanics and for teachers to increase confidence in teaching quantum.  The camps will be led by educators who have participated in the workshops, and will provide local opportunities for underrepresented groups.  The project will identify pedagogy appropriate for teaching QIS to high school teachers or students, and content concepts that are difficult to understand, through the use of pre- and post-content assessments, confidence surveys, and participant engagement.  Participants will be asked to provide feedback on the resources and curriculum in the classroom as well as the potential for classroom implementation and impact on interest in QIS and ICT careers. Results of the project will potentially inform other professional development models designed to serve underrepresented groups and reduce potential barriers to implementing new and complex content in the classroom.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Addressing the current challenges in CWE sustainability requires knowledge and skills of big data analytics, simulations, high-performance computing, and advanced cyberinfrastructures. Yet, their are inadequate training opportunities on integrating and working with data from different sources available to student for CWE research. These include data quality control, analysis, visualization, and simulations. This project fills this gap by creating a CyberTraining curriculum for CWE sustainability that builds on previous successes and incorporates rapidly-developing technology and community best practices in Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Science. This project provides CyberTraining to students, trainers and working professionals using publicly available data, simulation tools, and computing resources. <br/><br/>This project develops a CWE CyberTraining curriculum to provide training at three levels: (i) foundation level that can be used across multiple disciplines and audiences; (ii) expert level that teaches domain specific data and cyber tools knowledge in CWE domains; and (iii) developer level that provides advanced cyberinfrastructure training for addressing CWE sustainability problems. This curriculum builds upon a proven flexible modular approach, and can be implemented in the form of a sequence of credit courses, non-credit certificates, and degree certificate programs. This CWE CyberTraining curriculum will be disseminated through an open and scalable online platform to overcome technology barriers and enable broader adoption and community contribution. This unique platform will not only disseminate the curriculum, but also provide access to the tools and resources to co-develop and implement the curriculum. The project is co-led by a multi-disciplinary team that has rich experience in developing in-person and online learning modules, cyber-enabled data, computation tools, and platforms driven by community needs, and additionally incorporating these tools in their undergraduate and graduate courses. This project will directly train students at five universities, three community colleges and one high school through its partnership with minority serving institutions.

        "Abstract": "Although data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have touched almost every aspect of human life, design work processes have not fully benefited from these enormous opportunities. A better understanding of the dynamics of the design process can create long-lasting positive impacts on the architecture/engineering/construction (AEC) industry that has traditionally suffered from chronic productivity problems in the United States. This project will recognize and enable the development of computational and collaboration competencies as essential 21st century skills for the workplace. Emergent applications of AI in the design and construction workplaces make it vital for planning to train computationally fluent AEC professionals for the future workforce. As technology becomes more embedded into AEC systems, we expect that the criticality of computational fluency will rise. This research will provide an unprecedented opportunity for U.S. students to participate in the transformative rethinking of the design development process. It also sets the ground for training them for a promising, multidisciplinary career in design management, productivity assessment, AI, and design computing, while promoting intellectual cross pollination among these fields.<br/><br/>The proposed IRES AIHD-Singapore project will provide a unique ecosystem for U.S. students to study design transformation through the lens of data analytics and AI. IRES students will take ownership of a research project with researchers in internationally top-ranked universities in Singapore and form a global network of scholars to make substantial impacts on scientific and technical communities, and disseminate results via publications, conference presentations, and released open-source code. The U.S./Singapore faculty mentors will organize a set of cultural and professional activities before, during, and after the six-week internship at the AIHD-Singapore IRES site to enrich the students? experience. This project will establish an international network dedicated to educating and mentoring U.S. undergraduate students in AI and human designer collaboration. The international collaboration is expected to promote students? deeper understanding of design workflow in a data-rich environment where human designers benefit from AI to enhance design performance. The proposed professional and cultural workshops aim to address the critical shortage of data science talent in the U.S. AEC industry. The proposed collaboration among U.S./Singapore universities enhances the likelihood of the successful creation of a research community dedicated to developing a better understanding of how human designers can benefit from capabilities offered by big data and AI technologies in emerging collaborative design platforms. Students will engage in socio-cultural activities designed to expose them to Singaporean culture and history that provide context for fostering international scientific collaboration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The increasing dependence on the Internet and cloud computing has made data centers indispensable in modern society. However, operating these data centers requires a massive amount of electricity that contributes to the global energy crisis. Therefore, managing data center power usage to achieve energy efficiency is critical for a sustainable cyberinfrastructure. Towards that, server power monitoring plays a crucial role by offering valuable insights for exploring the optimization potential in data center operation. Moreover, fine-grained power monitoring can be vital in safeguarding data centers from outages and downtimes due to overloading and identifying anomalous server behaviors or malicious cyberattacks. However, server-level power monitoring has not been widely adopted due to the high cost associated with dedicated power meters at every server. This project breaks the cost barrier by developing a novel low-cost server-level power monitoring system that does not need dedicated power sensors at every server. Instead, it extracts multiple servers' power consumption data from single-point voltage measurements of the data center power distribution system. Beyond cost savings, the fine granular power monitoring achieved through this project can have a far-reaching impact by motivating data center operators to adopt more efficient and environment-friendly techniques. This project's research results and tools will be translated into educational materials for undergraduate and graduate courses. The project will also incorporate research activities involving women, underrepresented minority groups in STEM, and persons with disabilities through lab visits and summer internships. <br/><br/>The enabling insight for this project's novel power metering approach is that the power factor correction (PFC) circuits in the server power supply reveal their power usage information into the data center power network through high-frequency (kHz level) conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI). The conducted EMIs from servers can be measured from the data center voltage for server-level power monitoring. However, there are several technical challenges to realizing a conducted EMI monitoring system in data centers. The generation and propagation of conducted EMI in a data center environment are not well understood and how the data center architecture and the environment affect the server EMI is unexplored. In addition, extracting many servers' power consumption data from a single sensor poses fundamental challenges of source separation. Lastly, high-frequency EMI extraction and source separation require extensive and high-precision computation, while developing a real-time and cost-effective sensing system is non-trivial. In light of these challenges, this project's research efforts are organized through three research thrusts. The goal of Thrust 1 is to bridge the knowledge gap in conducted EMI in data centers through foundational research into conducted EMI generation, propagation, and extraction. Thrust 2 focuses on developing novel source separation algorithms to extract server-level power from a single sensor. Thrust 3 develops computation and cost-effective sensor hardware and software tailored to real-time monitoring. This project contributes to the knowledge base of source separation techniques and efficient real-time sensor data processing. The project advances the foundational understanding of conducted EMI in data center power networks. Moreover, conducted EMI is generated by many different types of equipment requiring regulated power. Hence, this project's outcome can stimulate the development of novel techniques dealing with conducted EMI issues in other domains. To foster such developments, all experiment data, codes, and designs of this project will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "In some species, males display traits that may provide information about their quality to potential female mates, and variation in those traits drives females to choose or avoid those males as mates. This study examines whether seasonal fat increase in wild nonhuman primate males is related to their reproductive success. This project advances knowledge about the evolution of physiology and sociality in our nonhuman primate relatives. This project also fosters the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM by providing mentored research to historically underrepresented groups such as first-generation students, low-income students, and students of color at Hispanic Serving Institutions. Undergraduate students work to collect and analyze field data and assist in the dissemination of the project findings. This project provides mentored research and field-based experiences, unique training opportunities for these students, and supports conservation of wild primates and their habitats through activities at the local level through educational outreach.<br/>This work provides new insight into sexual selection by examining the relationships among signals of mate quality, a measurement of genetic quality, and mate choice in a wild nonhuman primate. The research team integrate behavioral data collected in the field and molecular methods used in the laboratory to examine the reproductive consequences of individual variation in seasonal male fat increase, and test whether this variation is related to variation in Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes. Specifically, this project determines parent-offspring relationships and uses behavioral and genetic data to assess whether male fattening is a product of female choice, and thus an honest indicator of one marker of genetic quality, or a product of male-male competition and therefore decoupled from male MHC diversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant will contribute to the advancement of national prosperity and economic welfare by yielding insights into crowd logistics platform design.  Crowd logistics is a term that describes crowdsourced transport and delivery of goods and freight.  Senders source cost-effective logistics services from individual carriers via an online platform, which is controlled by a digital management system.  To be successful, a platform must rapidly scale up its sender and carrier networks.  If there are too few participants, senders and recipients will be dissatisfied by unfilled service requests, carriers will have insufficient opportunities, and the initiative will fail.  This award supports a fundamental understanding of crowd logistics platform design for robust network growth and performance by attracting and retaining participants having a variety of economic and social motivations.  The knowledge gained from this research will facilitate the use of crowd logistics for resilient food distribution in the face of large-scale disruptions, such as the COVID-19 emergency.  The educational plan seeks to implement participatory modeling activities that will improve STEM students? capacity for systems thinking, which is critical in the design and analysis of complex logistics systems.  <br/><br/>This research will produce a novel agent-based modeling approach to systematically explore the impacts of a crowd logistics platform?s design on its ability to quickly achieve a critical mass of participants.  This approach will model the degree of control that a platform management system assumes over participants? digital exchanges.  At one end of the spectrum is a platform characterized by centralized control, full automation, and algorithmic management; at the other end is a platform with decentralized control and community-driven exchanges.  Existing research on crowdsourcing platform design suggests that the degree of centralization of control impacts platform growth over time. However, understanding and predicting network effects that will lead to long-term platform growth is challenging, because the feedback loop perpetuated by participant decisions and interactions yields complex and dynamic system behavior. This research will address this challenge by representing carriers and senders as autonomous, heterogeneous, and adaptive agents, whose decisions to participate in a crowd logistics platform impact the participation of other agents over time.  Participatory modeling sessions with crowd logistics practitioners will be leveraged for model validation, to ensure that agent behaviors correspond to those of their real-world counterparts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Species are a fundamental unit of diversity in the natural world. Therefore, accurately documenting species diversity has important implications in life sciences, habitat management, and conservation. Yet, despite the importance of species in understanding biodiversity, it is often difficult to identify unambiguous species boundaries in many taxonomic groups. Lizards are one such example of a taxonomic group with genetically-different populations that often look very similar. What appears to be one lizard species is often a species group of several possible lizard species. In this project, the researchers will collaborate with scientists across 15 different institutions to determine species boundaries in 30 species groups of North American lizards. Doing so will (1) connect scientific understandings of how species form to the practice of naming species and (2) model an intellectual and methodological framework for naming species consistently in other taxonomic groups. The researchers will share their research findings at community events across three metropolitan regions, engage undergraduate students in authentic research, and guide taxonomic revisions to promote stable species names.<br/><br/>This project will use an integrative approach to delimit species. First, the project team will collaborate with taxonomic experts to generate range-wide genetic, ecological, and morphological sampling for each focal species group. These data will then be analyzed consistently to characterize levels of genetic and phenotypic divergence within each species complex. Then, the project team will assay levels of reproductive isolation between candidate species by using genetic data to measure the extent of hybridization and introgression between them. By comparing data on divergence and isolation, the team will characterize the rate and pace at which reproductive isolation evolves. Using these estimates, the team will then define the population-species boundary and apply it to the 30 focal groups to identify taxonomic units that show the highest levels of durability through time. Finally, using the revised taxonomy, the team will evaluate species delimitation methods that define taxonomic units based solely on genetic data. While efficient, these methods can be biased, and this analysis will identify the potential causes for these biases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Immersive videos, also known as 360-degree videos, provide viewers with a complete visual perspective of their environment. The global market for immersive video is projected to reach 22 billion U.S. dollars by 2025. With the rising popularity of 360-degree videos, network operators and service providers are increasingly keen on gaining insights into users? Quality of Experience (QoE) perception. However, the conventional QoE models designed for two dimensional videos fall short of capturing users? unique subjective feelings in viewing this new type of video. To bridge this gap, the project focuses on constructing human-centered models that utilize ?human factors? via a variety of virtual reality (VR) onboard sensors. Leveraging multi-modal sensory readings, the researchers will tap into a direct representation of users? perceptual experiences. This approach captures subjective feelings often missed by the objective system parameters commonly used in existing QoE models. The success of this project will provide an in-depth understanding of users? nuanced perceptual experience while engaging with 360-degree videos. It will create opportunities for stakeholders to implement user-specific network resource optimization and video streaming strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction on an individual basis. The research outcomes will significantly contribute to the human-centered sensing and networking research communities and benefit numerous VR applications beyond 360-degree videos.<br/><br/>This project involves three closely related research thrusts. The first thrust investigates how to extract salient features from multi-modal sensory readings for effective QoE assessment. To combat bias arising from datasets with unevenly distributed labels, novel approaches will be developed to augment underrepresented data by exploring useful information across sensing modalities. The second thrust seeks to optimize system resource utilization for QoE assessment. Multiple personalized models will share common neural network layers at edge servers for resource-efficient model hosting. Adaptive sampling will be applied at VR terminals during sensory data acquisition to maintain data utility. The third thrust focuses on devising data privacy protection mechanisms without sacrificing QoE assessment accuracy. Under the differential privacy framework, the approach features formal quantification of data correlation of multi-modality sensory data, which has been largely overlooked by prior work. The proposed research is inter-disciplinary, which spans data-driven modeling, sensing, and privacy-preserving computing. The proposed mechanisms and designs will be thoroughly evaluated via a combination of measurement campaigns, simulations, and experimental studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Humans modify natural habitats, such as forest and grasslands, to create agricultural fields and developed areas for people to live. This project aims to understand why such human-caused habitat modification causes extreme biodiversity loss in some places, while other places are more resilient. One idea suggests that small islands are especially at risk, because they can only evolve a small set of species that can only use a few types of resources or habitats. In contrast very large islands evolve many species, at least some of which will have less specialized requirements and may be able to prosper in human-modified environments. The researchers will test the hypothesis that biodiversity persists better in human-modified areas on bigger islands, as predicted by a \"lottery model\" of tolerance to human land-use. Relatedly, they will study if species' evolutionary history affects how much biodiversity remains in human-modified areas. Specifically, they will examine whether species that arrived on an island from elsewhere are more likely to tolerate human-modified environments, in comparison to species that evolved on the island in question. Understanding why some areas are more vulnerable to losing biodiversity will help prioritize places to conserve. Relatedly, knowledge of where biodiversity will be most robust to loss will help maximize use of ecosystem services that benefit people. The research will support undergraduate and graduate student training and promote scientific collaboration between US and Chinese biodiversity researchers.<br/><br/>To understand when and where biodiversity declines will be most severe after habitat modification, the researchers will examine communities of birds, reptiles, and amphibians in both natural habitats and human-developed areas. They will do so across islands of different sizes and isolations in both the Caribbean and Zhoushan Archipelagos (China). Together this combination of species groups and locations allows the researchers to distinguish good dispersing species (birds) from poor dispersing ones (reptiles and amphibians) in island systems where dispersal is easy (in Zhoushan, because between-island distances are small) versus hard (in the Caribbean, where distances are long). The researchers will use transects and long-term audio recordings to assess species occurrence over hundreds of locations across 56 islands in the two regions. They will quantify how specialized species are by studying diet and habitat use of the organisms encountered.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The ubiquity of networked communication systems in society raises ever-growing security and privacy concerns. In particular, such concerns exist for applications that collect private user information, as in health monitoring, e-commerce, and financial services, and applications associated with critical infrastructure as in transportation, smart grids, or process supervisory management systems. Indeed, for these applications, a single compromised/malicious agent or node of the network can provoke catastrophic events such as ransom payments to recover private data, large-scale electricity blackouts, interruptions of service, data breaches, financial losses, or fatalities. This project aims to explore how distributing the authority to launch critical tasks in the hands of multiple, rather than a single, nodes or users of the network can be an efficient means to avoid having a single point of failure and hence losing private data in its entirety in the case of a security breach. Furthermore, the proposed research studies how authority distribution is able to empower networks with the capability of coping with compromised devices or persons before they are identified as malicious and, most importantly, before they are able to do any harm.<br/><br/>The project investigates novel solutions beyond traditional threshold cryptography to address challenging roadblocks in authority distribution for data access and biometric authentication. Specifically, the project aims to overcome (i) privacy challenges with the use of biometrics, (ii) the need for costly resources as perfectly secure communication channels, (iii) a poor scaling behavior with the number of users, and (iv) the need for a central entity which is not compatible with distributed systems, to unravel fundamental trade-offs between privacy and storage requirements. The project comprises three interrelated thrusts. The first thrust studies the fundamental security and privacy guarantees that authority distribution can offer in the presence of, potentially unnoticed, compromised users or nodes. The second thrust investigates the construction of low-complexity coding schemes for authority distribution that operate at finite blocklengths, based on novel methods derived from error control coding and cryptography. The third thrust aims to enable a universal learning framework for authority distribution via deep learning that is independent of the data statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "With the advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence, assistive robotic systems have the potential to provide support and care to people with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). As robots become more widespread, like today?s mobile phones, assistive robots can play a significant role in assisting persons with disabilities at home, improving independence and everyday quality of life. For example, a robot may assist an individual with motor impairments to perform a task, such as preparing lunch. Current research focuses on ensuring safe human-robot cooperation in industrial environments, which will not threaten or harm the physical health of the human teammate. However, there is limited research on understanding the cognitive or mental state of a human who cooperates with an assistive robot daily for performing activities of daily living. This is important for developing effective, intuitive, and personalized human-robot cooperation. The objective of this project is to design and develop an end-to-end personalized assistive robotic system, called iRCSA (Intelligent Robotic Cooperation for Safe Assistance), to recognize, assess, and respond to a human?s cognitive fatigue during human-robot cooperation. The focus of the system is on human-robot cooperative tasks where a human with SCI and a robot cooperate during daily tasks (e.g., cooking). Students who have experienced SCI will be involved in every stage of the project, to ensure the acceptability and usability of the proposed system. In addition to the significant impact of this research on the improvement of life independence for persons with disabilities, the project includes the development of new university courses for assistive technologies and summer school programs for K-12 students, so that students gain knowledge on robotics and assistive technologies for their prospective studies in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM).  <br/><br/>This project will develop an end-to-end framework for online cognitive fatigue assessment as part of the proposed Human-Robot Cooperation (HRC) system, which constitutes a breakthrough in the ability to effectively integrate the human component in the adaptation (personalization) of assistive robots and address key HRC challenges through these three thrusts: (a) The development of a novel human-technology system for online cognitive fatigue assessment using multimodal data; (b) the development of an adaptive robotic system for personalized interaction based on cognitive fatigue assessment; and (c) an experimental testbed of HRC scenarios to enable HRC, machine/deep learning, and robotic systems computational advances. In addition to detecting a user?s cognitive fatigue, the HRC system assesses the level of cognitive fatigue severity so that new methodologies can be designed to provide personalized robotic interactions based on the user?s state of cognitive fatigue. A participatory action research approach will be followed involving students with motor impairments throughout the project. Evaluation of the system will identify system benefits and weaknesses to improve HRC for persons with paralysis, as well as assess system usability, reliability, and user experience. Beyond the assistive robotic applications, the project will advance research in multimodal machine learning for intelligent online assessment and control in several fields where teaming between robots and humans is required.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Tides are an important factor in many astrophysical settings.  Tides can affect life, like tidal cycles on Earth; they can affect geology, as in the intense tidal pull of Jupiter on Io; and can even influence the evolution of stars in binary pairs.  A research collaboration between Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Virginia (UVA) will analyze tidal friction in close star-star and star-planet binaries and assess the importance of nonlinear fluid dynamics on tides in these systems.   Fluid dynamics is the science of how gases and liquids flow, and a nonlinear system is one in which the change in the output has a complicated (not simply linear) mathematical relationship with a change in the input.  The principal investigators (PIs) have developed the basic theory and computational methods to study both weakly and strongly nonlinear tidal fluid dynamics.  The proposed calculations will advance the state of the art in order to provide physics-based prescriptions for tidal friction over a range of stellar types, evolutionary stages, and degree of nonlinearity of the tide. The detailed calculations and numerical simulations will be distilled into simple prescriptions which may be useful for future investigations by astrophysicists.  The MIT PI will serve as a research mentor in the study of tides to a student each year in the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP). MSRP began as an MIT initiative to address the issue of underrepresentation of African Americans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans and Puerto Ricans in engineering and science in the US. It seeks to identify talented undergraduate students from US institutions who are underrepresented minorities and might benefit from spending a summer (nine weeks) at MIT working in a research group. The UVA PI will mentor undergraduate participants in the Virginia-North Carolina Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, which seeks to broaden participation of underrepresented minority populations in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Three projects are proposed: (1) Orbital decay of hot Jupiters driven by weakly nonlinear wave-wave interactions. Previous work on solar-type stars will be expanded to include a range of stellar masses and evolutionary states. (2) Circularization and orbital decay in the strongly nonlinear limit, where wave breaking occurs for gravity waves. Again the goal is to expand previous calculations to the observed range of main sequence stars, as well as sub-giant and red giant branch stars. (3) Nonlinear wave interaction effects on the tide raised in the star and in the planet during high eccentricity planet migration. For each project, a detailed comparison of theoretical predictions to available data will be carried out. This includes close stellar binaries, the hot Jupiters and Neptunes around a variety of main sequence stars, and evolved stars with substellar companions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Visual impairment (blind or low vision) affects over seven million people in the United States. Their daily activities are more challenging.  They also have a harder time finding and keeping jobs. One major challenge for people who are blind or have low vision is getting around in unfamiliar places. Such places can change often and be unpredictable. Employers worry about hiring people with visual impairments because of potential legal issues. New developments in robotics could help people with visual impairments.  This project will figure out if people with visual impairments can use robots at work.  Telerobots have a human user who drives the robot, while the robot supplies sensor data. The research team will do surveys, interviews, and studies with individuals who have visual impairments. This will help to identify problems with training people with visual impairments to use telerobots. The goal is to help blind and low vision users to be independent and hold technology jobs.  <br/> <br/>The project has several aims. The research team is partnering with Austin Lighthouse (ALH). ALH employs hundreds of legally blind and low vision warehouse workers. Surveys will clarify the challenges people with visual impairments have getting or keeping jobs. We will interview employees at ALH to understand their needs and if they want to use the technology. Another aim is to design and do pilot studies that simulate telerobotic tasks. This will help us learn how to train blind and low vision individuals to use telerobots. It will also help make the system easier and more intuitive to use. The team will test different user interfaces to develop a telerobotic training prototype. The team will confirm the survey and interview results through telerobot training sessions. These results could give insights into how blind and low vision people do physical tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This biennial ASP series has been ongoing since 2010 and has solidly established itself within the African continent and worldwide. Each school in the ASP series is located in the region of sub-Saharan Africa and strategically select participating students throughout the entire continent of Africa with the focus on ethnic and gender balance. In this regard, ASP contributes significantly to the ethnic and gender diversifications in the field of physics and is an excellent example of a successful capacity building program. The knowledge of fundamental physics and the associated necessary technical skills are excellent motivations for students of science. In this regard, ASP is an essential avenue for DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) in the field of physics in general, which is dominated by non-African ethnic groups and by males. The goals of ASP are to build capacity to harvest, interpret and exploit the results of current and future physics experiments and to increase proficiency in related applications. ASP program is based on a close interplay between theoretical, experimental and applied physics. The participating students are selected from the entire African continent to ensure benefits to diverse group of students in all genders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Ferroelectrics are important materials used for sensing and telecommunication.  Mechanical motion can be induced in ferroelectrics by applying electric fields, which manipulate the orientation of nanoscale clusters of electric dipoles, known as domains. Advances in the growth of thin films now allow artificial ferroelectric materials to be created by combining layers that differ in chemical composition or domains into a single structure, one atomic layer at a time. In comparison to traditional ferroelectric materials, artificial systems offer new ways to manipulate domains and thereby mechanical behavior. This award aims to understand how ?smart? mechanical behaviors, such as the ability to induce mechanical motion with light or the ability to tune mechanical resonance with light or stress, can be engineered in artificial ferroelectrics. This research will integrate advanced computational techniques with the fabrication and characterization of microscale mechanical devices based on artificial ferroelectrics. The project will also provide opportunities to educate and train graduate and undergraduate students in the cross-disciplinary areas of materials science, physics, device engineering, and data science. Outreach and dissemination efforts will include educational modules for local middle and high school students, as well as displays for Dallas and Fort Worth area science museums. <br/><br/>Ferroelectrics are key materials in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Recent advances in thin-film epitaxy have enabled artificial ferroelectric systems to be created by combining compositionally diverse layers into monolithic heterostructures. In contrast to systems of homogeneous composition, artificial systems offer unprecedented pathways to tune the free energy landscape, and thereby mechanical response. This proposal aims to elucidate how free energy landscapes, and thereby mechanical functionality, can be rationally engineered in artificial ferroelectric heterostructures. Of particular interest are materials poised near instabilities in the free energy landscape that may lead to dramatic mechanical response to perturbations. Such materials could also exhibit smart functional characteristics, including light-induced mechanical actuation and mechanical resonance that can be tuned on-demand. The approach involves phase-field modelling of ferroelectric heterostructures comprised of perovskite ABO3 (A = Sr, Ba; B = Ti, Zr) layers of varying composition. Machine learning on a database generated by high-throughput phase-field simulations will identify and correlate key material characteristics (or ?fingerprints?) of heterostructures to mechanical response. Heterostructures will be experimentally realized through epitaxial growth on silicon using oxide molecular beam epitaxy. Microbeam resonators and cantilevers will be created from these heterostructures, and electromechanical behavior will be probed under perturbation of mechanical stress and optical excitation to form a close-loop study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This project aims to identify disease-specific changes in human brain connectivity in early stages by developing a novel Deep Learning framework applicable to data with arbitrary structure such as graphs. This is important because regional brain variations often do not manifest as cognitive changes until significant brain pathology has accumulated, and a better understanding of the brain may be possible by characterizing changes in connectivity defined by relationships between different brain regions. Recent techniques with Deep Learning have demonstrated successful results with human-level precision in various image analysis tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, but they cannot be directly applied to analyze brain connectivity because of its arbitrary structure. The key is to derive effective representation of the data; however, it is still unclear how to derive sophisticated representations for complex data such as graphs and it often requires large-scale datasets. A novel Graph Deep Learning technique that can detect subtle changes in brain connectivity with small numbers of samples is therefore necessary. Success of this project will facilitate understanding of the relationship between brain connectivity and neurodegenerative disease, mechanisms for early diagnosis, and discovery of new treatments. <br/><br/>Technically, the overarching goal of this project is to design a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model for graph data and to determine the extent to which it yields new scientific findings in neuroscience. To meet the goal, this project will focus on: 1) Developing a novel transform for graphs (e.g., brain networks) for their novel multi-resolution representations that are theoretically described by convolution, 2) Developing an efficient deep learning architecture for graphs that operates within a small sample-size regime to improve performance of disease diagnosis and sensitivity of statistical inferences, and 3) Validating the developed models on a simulation study as well as real brain network datasets for Alzheimer?s Disease to characterize disease-specific patterns in the brain connectivity. The developed framework will benefit various areas of neuroimaging research with functional and structural brain connectivity that are locally carried at small scales, and spur development of further studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Technological advancements in sensing and computing technologies have led to an unprecedented increase in the amount of data generated by scientific applications. As science projects are increasingly distributed in nature, the increase in data sizes in turn results in an increased volume of traffic that needs to be moved across geographically distributed locations. Although significant investments have been made to build high-speed networks to facilitate data movements between research and education institutions, it is difficult for domain scientists to efficiently utilize this available capacity mainly due to the lack of scalable data transfer services. This project addresses this need by developing a scalable and reliable data transfer service. It further integrates the data transfer service into elastic workflow management systems to achieve end-to-end optimization for distributed science workflows.<br/> <br/>This project makes three novel contributions to the field: (i) it innovates scalable integrity verification and encryption for file transfers to ensure the reliability of file transfers without sacrificing performance. It takes advantage of computing resources available at data transfer nodes to scale the performance of integrity verification and channel encryption features. (ii) It innovates end-to-end parallelism for distributed workflows by integrating an online transfer optimization service into elastic workflow management tools. Unlike existing workflow management solutions, which merely focus on the optimization of computing tasks, the proposed integration of online transfer optimization services into elastic workflow schedulers enables true end-to-end parallelism for distributed workflows. (iii) Finally, it demonstrates the performance of the developed service on a real-world bioscience workflow that streams a large volume of sequence read archive data from the NCBI database to extract computation-ready SAM/BAM files.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "It has long been known that changes in the environment can influence the ability of mothers to provision their offspring. Therefore, when should mom evolve to anticipate a change in the environment to best provision her offspring? This research will address this question by testing hypotheses regarding the ecological conditions that drive maternal offspring provisioning strategies. The work focuses on Trinidadian killifish, which exhibit maternal provisioning strategies that are easy to quantify. Additionally, killifish experience a wide range of ecological conditions. Finally, killifish are easy to manipulate, allowing for experimental tests of how natural selection influences offspring provisioning. Therefore, this research is well-positioned to provide new insights into how and why maternal provisioning strategies evolve. The work has broad implications for understanding the mechanisms by which organisms respond to environmental change. Further, it will improve researchers? ability to forecast how species respond to environmental stressors. The research goals will be combined with a plan for broader impacts that that uses killifish as a model to improve teaching, engage undergraduates from underrepresented groups in research at a Hispanic serving institution, and provide public outreach.<br/><br/>Much research has explored whether mothers respond to predictable shifts in environmental signals by modifying offspring phenotypes to best match future conditions. Yet, there is little evidence for the existence of such ?anticipatory maternal effects?. This shows that our understanding of the evolution of maternal effects is incomplete.  'Maternal condition transfer effects' represents an alternative to anticipatory effects that occur when the environment experienced by females during development influences offspring fitness. These effects are not driven by external signals but are instead a byproduct of past environmental quality. Condition transfer effects have received far less attention that anticipatory effects but are likely quite widespread. Interestingly, little work has considered the conditions that favor the evolution condition transfer vs. anticipatory effects. This project will use populations of killifish on the island of Trinidad to pursue three central goals. The research will: (1) determine if predator-mediated divergence in resource availability favors evolutionary shifts in maternal effects (i.e., condition transfer vs. anticipatory effects). (2) Test the connection between divergent natural selection, maternal condition, and offspring fitness via ?offspring outplant experiments?. (3) Experimentally evaluate the influence of resource availability on the evolution of maternal effects via long-term perturbations performed in natural streams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This grant supports research that creates new knowledge to program the shape of polymeric materials for scalable and customizable 3D manufacturing of soft conductive materials.  The manufacturing process will print 2D materials encoded with spatially controlled information allowing the structure to later transform into predetermined 3D structures.  This 2D printable 3D manufacturing technology provides new ways to design and fabricate soft engineering systems, including those based on environment-responsive, shape-morphing 3D materials.  The concept is applicable to other material systems over a range of length scales for broad applications, including soft electronic devices, soft machines, deployable systems, wearable devices, human?machine interfaces, and energy storage devices.  This research contributes to sustaining global leadership of the United States in advanced manufacturing and benefit the United States economy and society.  The research project provides opportunities for the development of developing the next generation of multidisciplinary researchers with expertise in additive manufacturing, soft materials, and computer science, enhance research-oriented multidisciplinary education through integration of research and education, and engage K-12 students and the general public in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through museum and summer camp outreach programs.  These activities will also broaden participation of underrepresented minority students in science and engineering.   <br/><br/>Morphing 2D materials into programmed 3D structures presents a new approach to the additive manufacturing of programmable soft materials.  Despite its potential as a scalable, customizable, and deployable manufacturing technology, lack of programmable materials and how to design them remain a key challenge.  Such 3D shaping approaches have mostly been limited to soft tissue-like hydrogels directed at bioinspired and biomedical applications in aqueous environments.  This research investigates approaches to electrically conductive structures through the design and programming of the dual network polymer system consisting of hydrogels and ionoelastomers enabling scalable and customizable manufacturing of 3D structures of soft conductive materials.  The research investigates and develops approaches for the formation of structures with non-Gaussian curvature through the determination of the formation process using an inverse design strategy based on algorithm development. The research team will explore how to program 2D ionic liquid-based polymers for their 3D manufacturing, investigate how to control and thus enhance the mechanical properties of ionic liquid-based polymers to manufacture 3D structures of soft conductive materials with enhanced mechanical properties, and develop environment-responsive shape-morphing 3D structures of soft conductive materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation ? Research The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation ? Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project lies in the development of the next-generation portable and wearable gas analysis device that will play an important role in healthcare, industrial and workplace safety, and defense and national security. Real-world gas samples typically contain tens to hundreds of volatile organic compounds. Majority of gas sensors either lack the detection specificity or only respond to specific gases, which makes it challenging to detect specific gases from a complex background. Although advancement in portable gas chromatography in the past 20 years demonstrates great potential in the development of powerful portable and wearable gas analysis devices, it remains a grand challenge to achieve efficient separation and rapid detection for effective gas analysis in a compact, highly integrated, and cost-effective platform. The proposed technology provides unprecedented gas analysis speed, separation capability, sensitivity, ultra-compact size, and system scalability. Upon successful commercialization, the technology is envisioned to transform a powerful instrument in research labs to miniaturized sensors easily accepted and accessible by the general public with broad applications in healthcare, environment, industry, and national defense and security.  <br/> <br/>The proposed project is to develop a compact and portable on-chip ?GC system with photonic integrated circuit (PIC) for rapid and comprehensive volatile organic compounds gas analysis. The ?GC-PIC system combines on-chip nanophotonic sensor arrays and efficient vapor separation occurring in high-aspect ratio microfabricated Si GC columns. A reconstructive metasurface spectrometer is integrated for on-chip optical detection. The project addresses critical challenges in synergistic integration of different material/device technologies to minimize the system footprint, increase performance reliability and repeatability, and transition the technology from the lab to commercialization. The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in overcoming various technical challenges at the interface of optics, materials, microfabrication, sensing, manufacturing, signal processing, and scaling and to demonstrate a ?GC-PIC prototype.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>Perovskite materials are ternary metal oxides known to be useful as solar cell materials where solar energy can be absorbed and stored.  They are stable in aqueous and acidic environments and are generally composed of highly abundant elements; however, they are plagued by low photovoltaic efficiencies and low stability. The primary challenge is to increase this efficiency while maintaining the stability and use of abundant, nontoxic elements. To address this issue at a fundamental materials chemistry level, this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, is focused on establishing synthetic strategies to prepare a new class of materials, sulfide and oxysulfide perovskites. The syntheses of sulfide and oxysulfide perovskites are not well known or understood. Outcomes from this project will lay the foundation to impact solar energy technology to benefit society?s future energy needs. Additionally, as part of this project, graduate and undergraduate students are actively involved in hands-on training, scientific workshops and conferences, and mentorship experiences. A suite of literature-based active learning and teaching tools on solid-state and materials chemistry is developed as part of this project as well and will be disseminated via the IONIC VIPeR website.  <br/> <br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, is focused on establishing synthetic strategies of a new class of sulfide and oxysulfide perovskite materials, for which the syntheses are currently unknown or not understood. Conventional perovskites, ABO3 (A = s, d, or f metal and B = transition metal) are appealing solar energy materials because of their stability and inclusion of highly abundant elements. One major limitation of ABO3, however, is that they typically possess band gaps that are too large to efficiently absorb and store solar energy. The motivation for synthesizing novel sulfide and oxysulfide perovskites, ABS3 and AB(O,S)3 is to establish stable inorganic materials that could exhibit higher efficiency when integrated into photovoltaic devices. This project provides scientific training and career development of graduate and undergraduate students through hands-on experiences, scientific workshops and conferences, and mentorship. A suite of literature-based active learning and teaching tools advancing solid-state and materials chemistry education of chemistry undergraduates is developed as part of this project as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The accurate prediction of clinical outcomes is a critical aspect of personalized medicine, offering vital information that can shape patient treatment plans and ultimately affect patient prognosis. The current pathological grading/classification system requires extensive information processing by a human brain to interpret highly complex data resources. Histopathology, as the cornerstone of disease diagnosis, has advanced significantly with technological innovations allowing for the capture of images at greater speed and resolution. However, most current histopathological image analysis methods often overlook the complex hierarchical structures of tissues. Understanding the intricate interactions among various cell types, which form the cellular components and, in turn, tissue architectures, is crucial for insights into biology and disease status. Analyzing pathological images is crucial, but effectively integrating associated biomedical text data, such as pathological reports, preliminary diagnosis reports, and clinical notes, poses additional challenges. This variety of text data is defined as medical captions, akin to extended image captions, which provide necessary context but also introduce further complexity in diagnostics. Enhanced computational methods that simultaneously leverage pathological slides and their captions could revolutionize the accuracy and efficiency of predicting clinical outcomes.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop novel pathological image-text analysis tools for clinical outcome prediction. The project will focus on 1) developing algorithms for pathological image analysis, which include auto-prompting fine-tuning framework for subtype cell segmentation, cell-level graph learning, patch-level graph learning, and intelligent integration of cell-level graph and patch-level graph for clinical outcome prediction; 2) fine-tuning large language models using biomedical text data to obtain improved text embeddings, which include the development of algorithms for biomedical text data analysis, incorporating fine-tuning of deep pre-trained models for precise biomedical text data representation; 3) Integrating pathological image data with biomedical text data for clinical outcome prediction, which include novel algorithms for the intelligent integration of multi-modal data and cross-modal learning models to generate biomedical text data representation from the histopathological images of the same patient. The successful realization of these aims promises to provide healthcare professionals with powerful tools to enhance the decision-making process, personalize treatment plans, and improve overall patient outcomes. Additionally, the proposed study stands to offer broader insights into the integration of multi-modal medical data, setting a new standard for how medical informatics can be leveraged in the era of big data and precision medicine. The multidisciplinary nature of this project also provides unique opportunities for integrating its components into existing curricula, as well as inspiring scientific interests in K-12 students and underrepresented students. The results of this project will be disseminated in the form of peer-reviewed publications, open-source software, tutorials, seminars, and workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Creativity is a fundamental aspect of computing innovation and a driving force in arts, sciences, and engineering. It plays a crucial role in our economic and social advancement, serving as a precursor to scientific breakthroughs, technological developments, and novel cultural and aesthetic experiences.  Established in 1993, the ACM Creativity and Cognition (C&C) conference provides a platform for a diverse community of researchers, designers, engineers, and artists who converge to offer innovative, interdisciplinary insights on the nexus of creativity and cognition in technological innovation.  The 16th edition of C&C will take place June 24-26 in Chicago, IL; through supporting travel to Graduate and Undergraduate Symposia at the conference, this award will provide students with a unique opportunity to present early stage research and receive feedback from mentors with different disciplinary backgrounds. They will gain experience and skills in communicating their own work and critiquing the work of peers. They will come away with new research insights and possible directions, with better understanding of prior work and of the field overall, and with new awareness of potentially useful methods that draw from different disciplines.<br/><br/>This grant will provide travel support to about 8 graduate and 8 undergraduate students who otherwise have limited travel funding and so might not be able to attend.  Students will be selected based on their likely sustained interest around the conference topics and community and their financial need, with an eye toward supporting students from a diversity of disciplinary, personal, and institutional backgrounds.  Since many applicants will be first time conference attendees and writers, the organizing committee will also provide mentoring workshops for prospective attendees to both improve applications and build connections even for students who ultimately cannot attend.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Refractory metals and alloys of extremely high melting temperatures, particularly tungsten (chemical symbol: W), offer great potential for applications in harsh environments found in the space, defense, and nuclear applications, etc. Additive manufacturing has been explored in the research and development of tungsten parts because of its ability to produce complex single-piece components along with reducing lead times and prototype costs. However, the inherent brittleness and high susceptibility to cracking of this material class pose major challenges to its production using high-temperature additive manufacturing such as laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF). This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant supports fundamental research that will generate knowledge related to a new hybrid manufacturing technique, combing in-situ rolling and sealing layer-by-layer during LPBF of W parts, capable of performing real-time modifications during the process, and thus, producing parts with controlled and improved properties. The research will enable knowledge-driven processing designs for the advanced production technology of W parts, which would open doors to new applications ranging from waveguides and collimators for hypersonic aircraft leading edges and plasma-facing components in unique fusion reactors, and thereby, create opportunities to strengthen the U.S. economy and national security. This project will also design and deliver intriguing hands-on educational and outreach experiences for the recruitment of diverse high school students to STEM majors and the retainment of undergraduate and graduate students from underserved groups, while ensuring their success in STEM-related careers or post-graduate education.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this CAREER award is to understand the mechanisms that govern the evolution of the structures and properties of W made by layerwise rolling and sealing in LPBF. The team will first investigate how plastic deformation and strengthening, induced by rolling and nanoparticle sealing, respectively, affect the thermodynamic driving forces and kinetics in W as well as impacts on structural evolution, while encountering process cycles of melting and re-melting. Experimental studies will include LPBF sample fabrications with in-situ rolling-sealing and materials characterization techniques. Crystal plasticity, discrete dislocation dynamics, and cellular automata models will be integrated to investigate into the evolution of dislocations, microstructure, and texture during the process. Next, the project will unveil the fundamental mechanisms underlying the newly achieved W structure and its role in the development of ductile-to-brittle transition and recrystallization. Fracture toughness testing will be conducted to investigate the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, complemented by the crack-tip plasticity theory and thermo-kinetic analysis to discover their respective contributions to the transition temperature. Furthermore, annealing followed by microhardness testing will be employed to identify the recrystallization temperature, with recrystallization kinetic models and thermodynamic principles used to determine the recrystallization driving forces. Then, how the fabricated W structure influence deformation mechanisms and mechanical behavior will be elucidated through tensile testing up to fracture at different temperatures to evaluate the strength and ductility. In addition, the plastic behavior and its contributions toward strength and ductility will be studied using the modified Clyne model. The research findings will offer insights into the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the hybrid in-situ rolling-sealing LPBF and their influence on thermal and mechanical behaviors under various mechanical, nano-structural, and thermal constraints. Ultimately, the knowledge attained will enable the advancement of W materials through improving part performance and increasing the operating temperature limits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Although noteworthy growth in research on mathematics and science content instruction for students with extensive support needs (e.g., students with moderate/severe intellectual disability, and autism; ESN) has occurred over the past two decades, research on engineering practices with this student population is significantly lacking. By addressing the relevance of engineering to help people in meaningful contexts, engineering instruction may provide a unique way to engage students with ESN. With increased focus on STEM education for students with ESN, engineering practices highlight the importance of problem-solving skills (e.g., systems thinking, creativity). Further, for students with ESN, engineering lessons/units may provide a viable format for systematically planned math and science instruction, that naturally embeds opportunities to teach students skills promoting increased self-regulated learning. Due to lack of prior experience teaching engineering, little is known about how teachers of students with ESN scaffold instruction to build their students? engineering practices. Thus, this project focuses on teachers? development of engineering practices, including how teachers support their students? development of engineering-focused behaviors and mindsets through instruction. <br/><br/>This project involves four strands of work: (a) empirically investigating teachers? engineering instruction, (b) developing a framework of conceptual understanding of engineering education for students with ESN, (c) conducting design-based implementation research to support universally designed engineering instruction and instructional materials, and (d) producing and disseminating the instructional support framework and materials. First, the team will develop a framework of conceptual and epistemic understanding of engineering education for students with ESN. Data will then be collected across multiple mixed methods studies using (a) teacher interviews and focus groups; (b) evaluation of professional learning; (c) classroom observations and behavior coding; (d) fidelity of implementation of engineering curriculum; and (e) assessment of student engineering-focused behaviors and mindsets. Finally, after several rounds of iterative design for each component of the curriculum, the teacher participants will pilot implementation with students. Feedback obtained from this process, as well as unit enactments and data analysis, will be used to further refine the universally designed for learning engineering unit. Additionally, insights from project research will be used to further refine professional learning materials to better support teachers' ability to support engineering focused behaviors of students with ESN.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Amid the increasingly common megadroughts and global freshwater supply challenges, the massive water footprint of data centers makes them a critical and valuable player in the collective effort toward water sustainability. As such, it is imperative to adopt new approaches for data center management that explicitly address the water footprint as a sustainability metric. Nonetheless, existing research on data center water efficiency only takes users' compute demands as an external and uncontrollable input, keeping users entirely agnostic to their water footprint. This not only misses a significant opportunity for user-side demand management but also prevents environmentally conscious users from proactively exploiting their workload flexibility to contribute to data center water sustainability. To overcome this limitation and bridge the gap between data center operators and users, this project proposes a new user-interactive approach to data center water management, where users are provided with clear visibility of their fine-grained water footprints that enable their active contribution to water sustainability. Specifically, this project develops: (1) a fair and accurate water accounting system for data centers both at the user and facility levels; (2) a scalable user-interactive resource management approach that extracts users' scheduling flexibilities for water sustainability; and (3) an efficient online algorithm that achieves data center water self-sufficiency by leveraging alternative water sources such as rainwater harvesting.<br/><br/>This project contributes to several key goals of the Design for Environmental Sustainability in Computing (DESC) program. It enables environmentally conscious clouds to tap into users' workload scheduling flexibility and offers unparalleled visibility into the water footprint of a user's digital presence by developing new user-level sustainability metrics. These insights can encourage and empower a new generation of sustainability-aware users and drive digital infrastructure providers to adapt and enhance their business practices to align with environmental sustainability objectives. Additionally, by alleviating the stress on freshwater sources and utilities, this project contributes to water conservation efforts and environmental resilience in drought-prone regions. To increase the widespread impact of this project, the tools and products developed will be shared publicly and integrated into existing curricula. Finally, this project actively promotes inclusivity and diversity by involving women, underrepresented minority groups in STEM, and persons with disabilities, fostering a collaborative and inclusive research environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "How new traits arise, how organism-level phenotypes manifest through variation at the cellular level, and how trait variation is impacted by genomic changes that modify gene regulatory networks are fundamental questions for understanding the genomic basis of organismal phenotype. This collaborative project links these topics through studies of snake venom systems and the genomic, regulatory, physiological, cellular, and evolutionary mechanisms that drive variation in venom composition. The research aims to transform current understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms by integrating inferences across scales of biological organization, from single cells to whole organisms, and from within populations to distantly related species, and by applying new predictive frameworks to link genetic and phenotypic variation. New statistical approaches that leverage both cellular and evolutionary variation to generate, test, and refine hypotheses for how gene regulatory networks function ? innovations that are broadly applicable to any eukaryotic system ? will be developed and disseminated. The research will advance fundamental understanding of how natural selection acts to evolve, maintain, and finely tune complex traits. Mentoring and research training in integrative biology will be provided for 22 undergraduate and 8 graduate students across four institutions, and a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) will be implemented. In addition, the project includes workshops and online modules to enhance training in state-of-the-art genomics and biological data science. By providing new insights into how snake venom variation is regulated, the project will have broad ramifications for improving global treatment of snakebite, with potential to impact millions globally.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research program is to advance the ability to understand and predict how new gene regulatory networks arise and how variation in these networks shape complex physiological traits, using snake venom as a model system. This research aims to understand how complex physiological traits are controlled, how these regulatory networks arise and subsequently re-wire existing physiological systems, and to identify the mechanisms that shape cellular and evolutionary variation in organismal phenotypes. This project will formulate, refine, and test mechanistic hypotheses for gene regulatory networks underlying venom composition by integrating across biological and evolutionary scales, and by leveraging emerging statistical frameworks to link genomic variation and gene regulatory variation with cellular and evolutionary trait variation. New methods developed will integrate predictive approaches and diverse functional genomic data to test mechanistic hypotheses and predict the roles of regulatory elements, trans-acting factors and other features that govern venom composition, and to test how cellular and evolutionary heterogeneity together shape organismal-level phenotypes. Key products of this work include novel approaches and software that leverage both single-cell variation and evolutionary variation to explicitly test hypotheses for the roles of gene regulatory components (e.g., cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulatory factors) that will be broadly applicable for developing and testing hypotheses for gene regulatory mechanisms in any eukaryotic system. The proposed research includes methodological and theoretical scientific innovation, development of new tools and software for understanding and testing hypotheses of regulatory networks and their evolution, training, establishment of collaborative networks, and impactful outreach.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by BIO-IOS-Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics, BIO-DEB-Evolutionary Processes, and BIO-DEB-Systematics and Biodiversity Science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Animal communication systems have evolved an extraordinarily varied set of morphological and physiological structures and signals in order to control essential behavioral interactions, such as individual recognition, establishment of social hierarchies, territoriality, and intersexual selection. Visual, acoustic, and chemical signaling modes allow for complex repertoires of behavioral displays, yet little is known of how communication systems originated and evolved in most species in the animal tree of life, including reptiles. This project aims to fill this important gap by investigating the origin and evolution of novel communication mechanisms (epidermal glands) in lizards and how such systems are shaped by ecological and environmental parameters. Results from this research will provide a framework for predicting how human-induced environmental changes could impact chemical signaling. This project converges with NSF priorities for both science and society by expanding natural history collections and genetic resources in the U.S., building large data sets for comparative studies, developing new teaching materials focused on chemical communication, and directly contributing to scientific education and public outreach with the development of a new public exhibit at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.<br/><br/>Among lizards and snakes, chemical signaling has been increasingly acknowledged as a critical, yet underappreciated, component of communication. This project will use integrative methods and tools, including advanced imaging, biochemistry, phylogenetics, and gene expression across diverse lizard groups from North America, South America, and Africa to investigate the evolution of novel epidermal glands that are crucial in mediating behavioral interactions in several groups of lizards. This project will test several hypotheses with the diverse data types collected over the course of the research, including (1) chemical differences between species correlate with environmental parameters and structural complexity of the habitats and microhabitats; (2) major transitions in the presence or absence of epidermal glands and chemical signals across the lizard tree of life track shifts in habitat/microhabitat (such as changes in temperature, humidity, and solar radiation preferences); (3) independent origins of epidermal glands across the lizard tree of life share a common genetic origin, providing strong evidence that such structures share deep and common ancestry. By using lizard epidermal glands as our study system, this project will provide insight into the evolution of novelty and those structures that play important roles in communication and behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "As software permeates every aspect of our everyday lives, the problem of software reliability has grown both in importance and complexity. Software modeling has shown promise in providing ways to improve software reliability, however the specialization required to build accurate software models has limited their adoption. Current model development environments are rather ?bare bones,? providing no guidance or feedback other than the output itself, and limiting the revision process to the age-old ?edit and check.? This project aims to address these challenges through the creation of a new model development environment. The project?s novelties are new tools that combine live programming innovations with the strengths inherent to modeling languages to provide a range of contextualized feedback during development. The project?s impacts are in lowering the barrier to entry for software modeling and aiding formal methods education. <br/><br/>Concretely, this project focuses on bringing live programming to finite model finders to interweave the process of writing and evaluating a software model. To achieve this, the project investigates the efficacy of different live development interfaces that suggest edits to complete formulas and that help users explore and contrast how different edits impact the collection of scenarios produced. Since live programming elevates the role of the output, this project also explores a new model development workflow, output directed debugging, that enables users to edit the scenarios in order to correct the underlying model. In addition, these live interfaces will form the basis for an interactive learning environment for mathematical logic to improve formal methods education at both the undergraduate and graduate level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the USA, behind heart disease. In 2023, over 600,000 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the USA. One of the primary factors behind the high death rate for cancer patients is the late diagnosis of cancer, since most cancers do not present early symptoms. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop fast and effective targeted therapies for treating cancer patients. For this purpose, biomedical imaging is a crucial component for establishing clinical protocols in cancer by helping obtain important anatomical, structural, and functional information of cancer formation and spread. In particular hybrid imaging methods, which use physics of coupled waves, provide quantitative information of cancerous tissues to guide better diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. One such hybrid imaging method is quantitative photoacoustic tomography (QPAT) that uses short-pulse near infrared light and ultrasound propagation data to reconstruct high-fidelity optical properties, like light absorption and scattering profiles, in cancerous tissues. However, several practical challenges, like lack of adequate datasets and uncertainty of sound speed in tissues, limit the quality of reconstructions with existing computational methods in quantitative photoacoustic tomography. This project brings together a novel combination of theoretical and computational methods in mathematical game theory and statistical sensitivity analysis to tackle the aforementioned challenges and provide high quality reconstructions in QPAT. As a result, it will help facilitate accurate targeted imaging of cancerous tissues and improve clinical outcomes, thereby contributing to one of the strategic goals of USA Heath and Human Services to ?Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes?. Furthermore, this project will provide a unique interdisciplinary research and training experience for undergraduate and graduate students, especially from underrepresented groups, and will facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration between mathematicians, statisticians, and radiologists in the field of biomedical imaging.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to build a new class of accurate, fast, stable and robust non-linear reconstruction schemes for solving limited data hybrid imaging problems arising in QPAT. For achieving this goal, the specific research objectives are to (1) develop a new gradient-free Nash games computational scheme for data completion and identification of unknown sound speed and optical energy density in photoacoustic tomography; (2) build a new gradient-free optimization scheme for reconstruction of optical parameters with high contrast and resolution; and (3) use statistical sensitivity analysis to stabilize and calibrate the Nash algorithm for obtaining a stable reconstruction method in QPAT. The computational framework will be validated using real-time photoacoustic data of mice specimens. The project also aims at providing a new paradigm in computational methods for limited data inverse problems that yields computationally inexpensive, stable and superior reconstructions in comparison to existing computational frameworks, and thus will be beneficial for effective detection of cancers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 2 project aims to improve the retention and graduation of mechanical and aerospace engineering students by developing their engineering identity in their freshman/sophomore years. Past studies on engineering identity primarily focus on a single course with design components. This project will study implementing collaborative learning and design thinking in three freshman and sophomore courses to foster engineering identity. This project will generate new knowledge on how to produce a more diverse and innovative engineering workforce, which are critical for maintaining the US position as a global leader in science, technology, mathematics, and engineering (STEM).<br/><br/>The three objectives of this project, i.e., 1) bridge math gap, 2) build communities of practice, and 3) instill design thinking, contribute directly to the three constructs of engineering identity, i.e., performance/competence, recognition, and interests. To achieve these three objectives, the first strategy is to leverage collaborative learning by implementing in-class peer led team learning (iPLTL) in two freshman courses and collaborative learning in a sophomore gatekeeper course. The second strategy is to introduce ?design thinking? as a creative, iterative, human-centric process that guides decision-making and problem solving. Students will learn and practice how to apply design thinking to solve complex math, engineering, and life problems. The principal investigators will collaborate with students participating in a summer fellows program to create course contents, including videos. The student summer fellows will also participate in undergraduate research, accelerating their transition from engineering students to engineering practitioners. Leveraging student-faculty collaborations, this project will promote teaching/learning effectiveness, culture awareness, and community supports for both students and faculty. The outcomes and findings of this project will be disseminated via conference presentations, journal publications, seminars, and social media. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Decision-makers in business, legal, healthcare, and the military use natural language processing systems to obtain insights from vast amounts of data and to make more informed decisions. Recently, natural language generation systems (NLGs) are becoming popular. Examples include question and answer systems and chatbots that are used for advancing public health, and social sensing systems that are used for emergency response and crime prevention. However, there are risks that attackers may be able to manipulate these systems leading to poor outputs and poor decision-making. Robustness to adversaries in deep learning systems has become an active topic in the machine learning and security communities, but the robustness of NLG-based systems is much less studied. This is important to address because there are many differences in the nature of the data and algorithms deep learning and NLG systems employ, as well as the types of tasks they are used for. This project will address these differences through a comprehensive look at the kinds of attacks natural language generation systems are vulnerable to, developing both mathematical models of their vulnerabilities and strategies for reducing them through changes in how NLG systems are designed. This, in turn, will lead to safer, more trustworthy NLG systems and provide a number of educational opportunities for students involved in the research and related classes.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to understand NLG systems' attack surface and vulnerabilities and develop novel empirical and theoretical methods for increasing their adversarial robustness. The work will be grounded in two common NLG tasks, summarization and question-answering, and structured around three interconnected aims. The first is developing a framework and proposing novel AI-based optimization methods for examining NLG systems against various attack models. The second is having an in-depth analysis and characterization of vulnerabilities that lead to such attacks. The third is developing a set of defensive methods and tools for enhancing the robustness of NLG systems. This research will be integrated with education and outreach by providing research experiences for women and underrepresented groups, incorporating research results into the course content development and curriculum design, and organizing workshops and competitions to reduce the gap between NLP and cybersecurity programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is both a basic process in nature and a major problem in agriculture, resulting in crop losses and costly pesticide treatments. Plants defend themselves by producing natural chemicals that are toxic to insects, but insects have many ways to overcome these toxins. In addition to insects? own abilities, which are well studied, recent evidence suggests that bacteria living in the insect gut can help to break down plant toxins. When and how this happens, and its overall contribution to plant damage by insects, are poorly understood. The goal of this research is to identify which bacteria break down toxins from two common crop families (the tomato family and the cabbage family) and measure how much these bacteria help insects eat these plants. Understanding the different ways insects disable plant toxins will help us design more effective, targeted insect control strategies. Ultimately this could reduce crop losses and lessen the need for broad-spectrum pesticides. This project will also provide hands-on research experience for undergraduates at a Hispanic-serving institution, reaching a total of 120 students in the classroom and 30 students in the laboratory. Students will rear insects, infect them with different bacteria, measure the effects on the insects? health and plant consumption, and present their results in public and scientific venues. This will train both future members of our society and the next generation of STEM researchers in scientific thinking.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to predict the magnitude of detoxification assistance provided to insects by their gut microbiota, testing the hypothesis that host plant generalists will benefit more from microbial facilitation than specialists. Using beetles, grasshoppers and caterpillars feeding on Solanaceous and Brassicaceous plants, this research will: (1) Determine the abundance of allelochemical-degrading bacteria within wild insects? gut microbiota. Researchers will characterize gut microbial composition via 16S amplicon sequencing and simultaneously isolate live gut bacteria from the same insect individuals. The ability of these bacteria to degrade allelochemicals will be measured via culture-based assays. (2) Measure the magnitude of microbial detoxification in vivo. Researchers will inoculate generalist and specialist insects with toxin-degrading or non-degrading isolates and allow the insects to feed on plants. Concentrations of allelochemicals excreted in insect frass will be measured to determine how much microbial degradation occurred. (3) Quantify the impact of gut microbial facilitation on insect fitness and plant consumption. Generalist and specialist insects will be reared on their host plants, inoculated with an isolate that does or does not degrade one of the plant?s major toxins. Researchers will compare the insects? growth rate, development time to adulthood, survival, and total leaf area consumed. This work will quantify the overall importance ? or lack thereof ? of gut microbiota in insect herbivory and launch a career-long investigation of the role of gut microbiota in the plant-insect chemical arms race, a process that has generated much of Earth?s terrestrial biodiversity.<br/><br/>This award was jointly funded by the Symbiosis, Infection and Immunity Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and by the Population and Community Ecology Program in the Division of Environmental Biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to develop novel bio-inspired additives that will enhance carbon sequestration, mechanical performance, and the longevity of concrete. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) is one of the most energy-intensive manufacturing industries in the U.S. and is responsible for nearly 8% of global anthropogenic carbon emissions. Due to the high carbon footprint of OPC, a variety of alternative low-carbon cementitious materials have been developed in the past decade, many of which rely on carbon dioxide (CO2) curing. However, the potential chemical admixtures, that can enable controlling the performances of this new generation of CO2-cured concrete have not been well-explored yet, primarily due to the lack of understanding of the hardening mechanism of these materials. This project focuses on designing and resolving the upscaling challenges of bio-inspired additives specifically formulated for CO2-cured concrete. The bio-inspired additives will improve the functionality of CO2-cured concrete and therefore, expand the application sector for such low-carbon technologies. The application of such low-carbon technologies will enable the U.S. government?s goal of reaching Net Zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to upscale and evaluate the commercialization potential of bio-inspired additives via following four tasks: (i) evaluate the compatibility of bio-inspired additives with traditional chemical admixtures that are typically used to control different performances of concrete, (ii) investigate the effectiveness of bio-inspired additives at different length scales and environmental conditions with variable CO2 concentration levels, (iii) investigate the durability performances of concrete prepared using bio-inspired additives, and (iv) perform environmental impact assessment and techno-economic assessment of producing and using bio-inspired additives in the production of carbonation cured cementitious composites. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mineral is the primary binding phase that controls the strength as well as the CO2 sequestration capacity of carbonation-cured cementitious composites. A series of bio-inspired additives were found to be able to control the CaCO3 precipitation and polymorph conversion kinetics in carbonation-cured cementitious composites. By doing so, these additives can enhance the mechanical performance, CO2 sequestration capacity, and durability of carbonation-cured cementitious composites. To mitigate the potential risks of upscaling and commercialization of these bio-inspired additives, their performance and cost-effectiveness for different cementitious material systems, length scales, and environmental conditions will be evaluated in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "What animals are talking about is a fascinating research topic. Previous attempts to understand animal communications relied on behavioral observations, and have studied only a handful of species given high costs. None of these attempts have adopted a computational and systematic approach to associate animal vocal sounds to written symbols and meanings as we typically do with human languages. This project investigates whether animals  have languages that are syntactically and semantically compositional like humans, using current advanced machine learning methodology. In a preliminary study, the team has developed an \"animal language processing\" pipeline that cleans and preprocesses a large amount of YouTube videos about domestic dogs, and further transcribes the audio segments of dog vocalizations into a sequence of phonetic symbols. In this project, undergraduate researchers will collect high-quality, partially annotated multimedia animal communication data, feed it into the aforementioned pipeline, analyze the resulting transcripts and gain new insights on the languages of new species. The work conducted by the undergraduate researchers will also develop into an open-source web-based animal language study platform called AniVoice. The outcome of this project will be a step toward answering the big science question noted above, and eventually help better understand the world around us. This project will also support the undergraduate participants in developing a expertise in interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This project includes technical milestones. First, the researchers acquire high-quality, cleaned vocalization data of a target animal species, partially annotated with the activity or scenario the animal is involved in. Data is collected either by live recording, or downloading relevant video clips from the internet. Second, the researchers segment the audio files of animal communications into minimum units of audible sounds, much like the syllables of human speech, and then group regular animal syllable sequences into animal \"words\". This poses significant challenges because human beings do not know how to parse animal communications. Third, the researchers develop models to automatically understand the semantics of the words by looking at the activities or location of the animal when a certain word is uttered. This requires the implementation of video understanding algorithms, and in particular, scene and activity classification, as well as \"active speaker\" detection in a scene where multiple animals exist. Finally, the undergraduate researchers implement a web-based crowdsource interface where animal lovers or researchers can upload their recordings, annotate their data using the tools provided, and evaluate the transcription and semantic analysis results from the animal language processing pipeline. The AniVoice platform will be used as a tool to advance animal language studies in the future. Each year of this project, a cohort of undergraduate researchers will contribute by continuously improving the processing pipeline, adding more experimental evidence on more animal species, and improving the AniVoice web service. The analysis performed by the student researchers is expected to provide additional scientific evidence of the language abilities of target species, which may lead to new insights by biologists and behavioral ecologists. AniVoice opens opportunities for data-driven and interdisciplinary research collaboration on animal communications. The knowledge gained in this project may also be useful in the study of ancient or extinct human languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Part 1: Nontechnical description <br/>The production of concrete, the most widely used manufactured material worldwide, is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, resulting in 9-10% of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  Efforts for decarbonization in the concrete industry are still in a nascent stage, focusing primarily on CO2 mitigation strategies within the cement manufacturing process.  Considering that the global demand for concrete will grow by as much as 38% by 2050, the vision of this project is to establish a multidisciplinary consortium between Universities, Research Centers and Non-profit Organization in the U.S. and European Union to enable cross-disciplinary scientific and use-inspired technological advancements that (i) significantly enhance concrete?s ability for carbon capture by incorporating carbon neutral waste materials and nanostructured materials with a high CO2 uptake potential; and (ii) develop a novel technology for renewable electricity and large-scale power production by engineering for the time concrete to absorb high amounts of thermal energy and directly convert it into usable electrical energy.  Young faculty, early career researchers, and students from the U.S. will collaborate with their counterparts in the EU in specific training and research for decoupling concrete manufacturing and global greenhouse gas emissions.  The educational plan of this project is closely integrated with the research objectives and will contribute to the successful development of the next generation of the American engineering workforce that includes students from under-represented groups, technical and community college students, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Part 2: Technical description <br/>TE-CO2NCRETE pioneers a Thermoelectric Carbon Neutral Concrete with high CO2 capture and sequestration capacity, and the ability to absorb thermal energy from solar radiation and directly convert into usable electrical energy. Identification and control of the yet unexplored chemical interactions between functionalized multidimensional carbon-based nanostructures and calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) interfaces in the <10 nm length scale will provide a paradigm shift for designing nanoscale-to-macroscale structures that promote carbonation kinetics. Investigating the electron tunneling and phonon absorption in nanomaterial/C-S-H electrochemical cells via sub-picoampere electron tunneling spectroscopy and tuning the material?s conductivity and dielectric permittivity will enable controlled and rapid transformation of thermal gradients into electricity, a key to the successful development of a thermoelectric concrete battery for generation, long-duration storage, and transmission of electric power.  A transformative aspect of the project is the development of molecular dynamics methods that adapt for the first time the role of the atomic-to-nano scale 3D dimensionality, electrochemical and thermoelectric properties for developing CO2 mineralization and energy density realistic simulations in engineered concrete.  Designing the TE-CO2NCRETE has a potential of net carbon removal of 110 lbs CO2 per 1000 lbs concrete.  With a conservative estimate of 4.4 B tons concrete produced every year globally, our technology would result in 482 M tons CO2 absorbed annually, which is 7% greater than the current annual concrete production-related CO2 emissions (451 M tons); thus, enabling carbon negative concrete production globally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Vortex is intuitively recognized as a rotational/swirling motion of fluids. Vortex is omnipresent in the universe and affects human life and the environment. Humanity is faced with existential and catastrophic threats which are largely caused by vortex in many cases, such as human-induced climate change leads to extreme weather, unprecedented hurricanes, and life-threatening tornados.  In addition, pandemic and pollution-induced respiratory and heart diseases are rampant.  In many of these catastrophic events, the vortex plays a key role.  In addition, vortex controls the dynamics of turbulence and noise generation.  However, vortex had no rigorous definition, existing vortex identification methods are not accurate and appropriate, and the demonstrated vortex structure of turbulence is not unique. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive Liutex and third generation of vortex definition and identification. <br/><br/>The rigorous mathematical definition of local fluid rotation and global vortex will be further modified to be unique, accurate and appliable to vortex science and turbulence research. A high-order vortex identification software ? LiutexUTA, Modified Liutex-OmegaUTA, Liutex-Core-LineUTA methods ? will be developed and distributed to the turbulence research community. The 3-D Liutex generation mechanism will be revealed, which is a key issue of the hairpin vortex formation. The new Liutex-based Fluid Kinematics will be developed to guide fluid dynamics in education and research. The new Liutex/Vortex dynamics will be investigated, and the new fluid dynamics governing equations will be revisited and new ideas will be presented based on the research progress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Cloud-native technologies offer advanced and effective means to develop and manage today?s ubiquitous cloud applications. For example, monolithic cloud applications are being replaced with graphs of smaller, simpler ?microservices? for reduced development complexity and increased code velocity. Further, such microservices are managed by cloud-native systems automatically, liberating cloud users from onerous operations of their in-cloud applications. Unfortunately, systems software that underpins cloud-native systems, such as virtualization, faces critical challenges to meeting the stringent needs of emerging microservices-based cloud applications, such as strong-yet-lightweight isolation, fast inter-microservice communication, and fine-grained elasticity control. This CAREER project proposes to conduct a holistic study of virtualization techniques to 1) identify critical bottlenecks in resource isolation, I/O communication, and service elasticity; 2) propose new system virtualization solutions to address these bottlenecks; and 3) validate the proposed solutions with real-world prototypes. The knowledge developed in this project will advance the key aspects of systems software in cloud-native systems, thus benefiting all cloud applications that are integral to society running on these systems. The research outcomes will have influences on the design and implementation of production cloud-native systems via university-enterprise collaborations and technology transfer and be integrated into core computer science courses. This project will provide training in the computer systems domain to graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students, via diverse outreach plans of summer camps, high school student/instructor mentorship, and the inclusion of underrepresented minority and women engineers.<br/> <br/>The overarching goal of the CAREER project is to investigate and develop virtualization techniques for highly secure, efficient, and elastic cloud-native systems. First, the project will develop a strong-yet-lightweight isolation architecture for efficiently and securely sandboxing distributed microservices. It will move monolithic kernel functions to more isolated and lightweight userspace kernel microservices to provide system services to (and sandbox) all microservices of a cloud-native application. Second, the project will build fast userspace (network and storage) data planes tailored for interactive microservices. It will retrofit kernel I/O stacks to preserve high-quality kernel functionality meanwhile augmenting existing I/O stacks to address critical inter-layer data communication/processing bottlenecks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Non-volatile memory is a type of computer memory that can retain stored data upon a power loss or system crash. Due to its large capacity and low energy footprint compared to traditional volatile memory, non-volatile memory has long been envisioned as an ideal solution for building large-scale, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and recoverable applications in many critical domains, including high-performance computing, machine learning, and embedded systems. Although non-volatile memory is available as commercial memory chips and offers numerous promises, it has not yet been widely adopted in production systems. The major obstacle is the difficulty to ensure that data is timely and correctly written to non-volatile memory, allowing it to be restored to a consistent state after a crash. Currently, application developers carry the burden of porting legacy applications to non-volatile memory, which is tedious and error-prone. This project seeks to establish a generic framework for user-transparent persistence and crash consistency that allows unmodified legacy applications to run efficiently and correctly with non-volatile memory. The success of this project will help unleash the full potential of non-volatile memory and make it easier to adopt. The research will also provide valuable insights into data management in future hybrid, disaggregated memory systems. In addition, this project involves mentoring Ph.D. students, engaging minority students, course development, and K12 outreach activities. <br/><br/>This project integrates non-volatile memory into the page/buffer cache in memory management ? i.e., an abstraction that bridges the view of byte-addressable memory and a backing memory device -- to provide persistence and crash consistency to user-space programs with no or little user involvement. The challenges lie in 1) how to intercept program updates and redirect them to non-volatile memory for persistence; 2) how to properly order the updates and ensure update atomicity to guarantee crash consistency; 3) how to efficiently integrate non-volatile memory into page/buffer cache management without incurring noticeable overhead or performance degradation. This project addresses these challenges by focusing on persisting three types of program data ? file-backed data, dynamically allocated application memory, and program metadata for virtual memory management, such as page tables, and exploring various software and hardware techniques, such as copy-on-write, undo logging, shadow paging, and extended page tables, for each data type to achieve efficient crash consistency. This project advances the understanding of hybrid memory management for volatile and non-volatile memories while simultaneously achieving high usability, good backward compatibility, and high efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will support an integrated research, education, and outreach program in supply chain network (SCN) management. The main aim is to broaden the focus of SCN management from economic efficiency to accuracy, agility, and sustainability through dynamic network modeling and data-driven decision-making methods. The current supply chain analysis tool, relying on static optimization, is insensitive to non-eligible changes such as policy changes that may cause economic turmoil. By bridging supply chain management with the optimal network control concepts, this work will interpret the processes of producing and distributing goods of an established SCN in the dynamic form to capture the non-negligible changes more rapidly and maximize the utility. In addition to ushering in the concept of dynamic modeling for agile reaction to changes and effective decision-making on network management, this work will further discuss supply chains involving recycling processes through a multi-layer network model. The broad applicability of this work will provide expert guidance to local industries for improving SCN efficiency, profit, or recycling and will further promote awareness of the current waste issues and facilitate the local community's engagement toward green manufacturing and sustainability. In addition, in the long run, this project will deliver reliable solutions for many other SCNs that are crucial for the economic developments of many companies in related fields. This study will also adopt dynamic planning concepts for decision-making related to STEM student recruitment, retention, and training, which will facilitate engineering education reform from experience-based management to data-driven strategic planning. <br/><br/>The research will address problems related to the current poor management of SCNs that heavily rely on the power of computational devices by modeling supply chains as dynamic systems that capture the non-eligible changes and transforming SCN management from static optimization to model-based dynamic control. This model enables quantitative analysis of optimal strategies such as daily production and optimal distribution route, where a parallel computing scheme will be developed for computational efficiency. A demonstration metric on the feasibility and applicability of the proposed work, based on dynamic modeling, will be introduced for evaluation, which sets the foundation for the exploration of other complex dynamic networks. Furthermore, a multi-layer network will be adopted to improve the efficiency of SCNs, which will result in discussions on applications involving recycling processes for sustainability management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Dramatic development of information technology has produced an unprecedented volume of data around the world, providing an opportunity for researchers to leverage cyberinfrastructure (CI) to develop data-driven solutions to global issues. However, the research workforce in the energy and water fields are often under-equipped to incorporate CI into their workflows. This project creates a unique cybertraining opportunity for undergraduate researchers in the energy and water fields through an online, weeklong bootcamp, summer mentoring, and a closing research symposium. Students train in every facet of CI, from data access and sharing to data analytics and visualization, which are precursors to knowledge and discovery. The bootcamp and training materials will increase the application of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles in research, encouraging a transition towards just practices in research. Faculty participation in two workshops complement and extend the mission of the undergraduate researcher components. The overall goal of this project is to develop and test an extracurricular CI instructional framework while also identifying the CI adoption and implementation needs of the established research workforce, thus fulfilling NSF's mission to promote the progress of science. <br/><br/>This project seeks to develop and test an accessible framework and instructional materials for expanding CI adoption among diverse, budding researchers and to broaden the adoption of CI in established research laboratories. To do so, the project creates an intensive weeklong FAIR data principles and introductory machine learning bootcamp with an innovative research justice theme for undergraduate students conducting summer research in water or energy and delivers two workshops. The bootcamp explores high-impact topics for new CI users, including large-scale data access, data analytics, and data visualization. Mentoring of bootcamp participants will continue throughout the summer, and an end-of-summer online research symposium provides a forum for bootcamp participants to describe how they (1) applied FAIR principles in their summer research and (2) developed workflows and tools for research-related tasks, which may be developed into publishable resources. The two workshops identify opportunities for expanding CI in civil engineering research and explore ways to improve and scale bootcamp content and delivery. The FAIR bootcamp content is designed to encourage students to internalize the content and integrate it into their research, while simultaneously increasing the potential for participants to share their new knowledge and skills with summer research colleagues. This novel bottom-up approach to spreading CI knowledge strengthens the future science and engineering workforce by rapidly growing the number of active researchers with CI competencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in cloud computing have led to a wide adoption of virtualization techniques in modern computer systems which allow better utilization of computer resources. There is also a steady trend towards building future data centers and high-performance computers with a software-defined architecture. However, challenges remain in adopting virtualization in many critical domains.  First, there still exists a large performance gap between virtualized and physical systems, especially for high-speed devices, scientific workloads and latency-sensitive applications. Second, performance isolation and resource elasticity are often contradictory goals under the current models, which leaves much of the economic benefit of virtualization unexploited. Third, the additional system complexity in virtualiation undermines stability and predictability. This research addresses these issues and seeks to improve the performance, cost-effectiveness, and predictability of virtualized systems. The research will be tightly integrated into teaching and further broaden its impacts through mentoring and recruiting minority students, and outreach activities in K12 schools.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will identify gaps in the existing abstractions that cause performance degradation, inefficiencies and unpredictability, as well as pinpointing the essence of current abstractions that has enabled isolation, modularity and portability. The project entails three research thrusts: First, it will design and implement augmented abstractions for various types of virtualized systems, including virtual machines, containers and virtualized networks, to bridge the semantic gaps. Second, it will leverage the augmented abstractions to design efficient, effective and elastic resource management schemes while retaining much of the benefit of the existing abstractions. Third, it will increase the understanding of abstraction in multi-tenant systems and apply the knowledge to studying the inefficiencies of conventional systems and guide the design of new abstractions in emerging architectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Attribute design is one of the most challenging aspects of the Big Data Science pipeline, where raw attributes need to be transformed into easily-interpretable attributes that can aid data scientists in ad-hoc data exploration and building predictive models. Unfortunately, current automated techniques for attribute design do not offer adequate interpretability to the end user, and attribute designed by human data scientists is painstakingly slow and heavily reliant on domain expertise. This project will develop a novel and transformative approach to enable an ensemble of amateur human workers to be involved in the computational loop for attribute design. It will benefit various domains that require effective applications of Big Data Science. In addition, the project will improve the economic well-being of the country by involving amateur workers and fostering systematic development of a data science workforce. On the educational front, the project will have significant education and outreach activities that span K-12 as well as graduate Data Science education. <br/><br/>The research involves developing a suite of algorithms and techniques for understanding the opportunities and challenges of involving an ensemble of human workers in attribute design, which is inspired by ensemble methods in Machine Learning. The main focus is on iterative methods to guide amateur human workers even with limited domain expertise to suggest new attributes for data exploration and predictive modeling. The research makes fundamental advancements to engineering by integrating theoretically-proven attribute design algorithms with application-specific details of real-world data science tasks. A prototype will be rigorously evaluated involving datasets from several application domains and human workers. The outcomes of this research will spur significant research in next generation human-in-the-loop computing, as well as impact data exploration over huge, high dimensional and unfathomable datasets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will further contribute to the low-carbon future by advancing the understanding and applications of cementitious materials that can directly serve as carbon dioxide sinks. The outreach effort of this research involves developing a multidisciplinary workforce with faculty members and students from civil engineering, materials science, and chemistry to address the challenges of creating sustainable and durable materials for civil infrastructures. The direct educational benefits include mentored research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students as well as underrepresented groups. These opportunities will provide students with exposure to advanced research facilities and motivate them to pursue higher education in the field of infrastructure materials. <br/><br/>This research will capitalize on the biomimetic approaches of engineering the growth, aggregation, and characteristics of in-situ precipitated calcium carbonate particles to control the interaction between cementitious materials and carbon dioxide. The specific objectives include: (i) determining the effectiveness of in-situ precipitated metastable calcium carbonate (mCaCO3) and calcium carbonate-organic hybrid (mCOH) phases to avoid degradation of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and calcium aluminum silicate hydrate (C-A-S-H) gel phases when exposed to external carbon dioxide, thus enhancing the carbonation resistance of cementitious composites containing AAMs and SCMs; (ii) investigating how biomimetic molecules can be used to precipitate specific mCaCO3 with controlled morphologies and properties in carbonation cured matrices so that their in-situ formations can be leveraged to develop high-performance cementitious matrices; (iii) investigating the functional relationship between biomimetic molecules and the polymorphic crystallization of calcium carbonate particles, and therefore, developing non-natural and affordable biomimetic molecules that can be used as chemical admixtures in cementitious materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Ever-growing cyber-attacks can lead to data breaches and exposure of private user data held by third parties, including companies, government entities, or medical institutions. A possible solution to such a risk is to implement privacy-preserving protocols between users and third parties that prevent any private information disclosure in the first place. For instance, a user could prove to a third party that she holds a valid password without revealing the password. While solutions for such privacy-preserving problems exist, such solutions are poorly adapted to the open-access, noisy, bandwidth-limited, and distributed nature of wireless networks. Resorting to privacy-preserving protocols unadapted to wireless communication networks may result in suboptimal/inefficient solutions or, even worse, compromise privacy. This project addresses this challenge with a novel framework for privacy-preserving communication specifically adapted to wireless networks. The anticipated benefits are stronger privacy guarantees, improved data rates, and improved scalability, compared to traditional approaches. The project integrates an educational component in the broad field of cybersecurity under the form of i) graduate student training, ii) project- and research-oriented undergraduate student education, and iii) outreach to K-12 students.<br/><br/>This project aims to build a comprehensive framework that will enable the fundamental understanding and design of privacy-preserving wireless communication protocols. The construction of this framework is organized around three thrusts. In the first thrust, to improve data rates and scalability, the project investigates novel building blocks for privacy-preserving protocols that incorporate wireless communication constraints and enable multiuser communication protocols. In the second thrust, the project investigates solutions to make privacy-preserving protocols robust to adversarial behaviors. For instance, legitimate protocol users could exhibit malicious behaviors, or unauthorized network users could launch wireless-specific attacks, such as eavesdropping, jamming, or man-in-the-middle attacks. In the third thrust, the project explores the construction of low-complexity wireless protocols with information-theoretic privacy guarantees via novel coding techniques from coding theory, cryptography, and deep learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "With rapid expansion of renewable energy resources and residential smart home networks, power distributors in the future must respond to an extremely dynamic and complex supply-demand balancing problem, which will lead to a dramatically different energy market. To address such market transformation, the concept of demand response (DR) has been proposed to achieve dynamic supply-demand balance through customer side response of load and generation regulated by dynamic market electricity prices. Although there have been many encouraging advances in DR research, the current data analytics and optimization models are still limited in capability and scalability to achieve effective DR decision-making under various system and market uncertainties. The primary target of this project is to bridge this knowledge gap and provide new predictive modeling and optimization methods enabling effective DR decision management for load service entities (LSEs) to deploy practical and sustainable DR programs in the energy markets. The methodological breakthroughs in this project have broad societal impact on facilitating smart grid transformation in the upcoming years for large-scale integration of renewable energy resources and residential smart home networks. This project will organize outreach and educational activities to broaden a diverse student participation, particularly underrepresented minorities, in highly impactful research areas that integrate data science, statistics, machine learning, and optimization for complex system decision-making in the big data era. Results of this research will be disseminated through a series of workshops and seminars on decision analytics, probabilistic machine learning, and smart energy technologies. <br/><br/>To address the challenges of deploying practical and sustainable demand response (DR) programs in a stochastic smart grid market, this research will establish new mathematical modeling and stochastic optimization methods via three integrated research tasks: 1) develop a new probabilistic deep learning method to investigate complex spatial-temporal variable interactions and make sequential forecasts with uncertainty quantification; and accordingly develop new forecasting models for key market variables, such as electricity price, load and renewable generation, etc.; 2) develop a multi-agent adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) approach for a comprehensive DR planning and operational optimization framework to achieve real-time optimal intra-day DR operations; 3) develop a two-stage optimization framework to optimize energy transactions and DR decisions in the day-ahead energy markets. The probabilistic deep learning method combines Bayesian nonparametric methods with deep learning structures to solve complex multivariate sequence-to-sequence forecasting problems. It is critical to quantify forecasting errors precisely to mitigate risks of decision making in uncertain markets. Both the multi-agent ADP and two-stage optimization problems will use a design and analysis of computer experiments approach that will enable effective real-time and day-ahead decision-making processes for an LSE to interact with dynamic customer agents and stochastic smart energy markets. The outcomes of this research will construct a solid methodological foundation to develop effective and sustainable DR management programs for the emerging smart energy markets. This project will advance the frontiers of knowledge in probabilistic deep learning and stochastic optimization research to solve many challenging real-world decision-making problems in highly stochastic environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, a critical challenge that needs to be addressed is their energy and computational cost. Foundational research in the design, verification, operation, and evaluation of deep generative AI hardware and software through novel approaches in emerging devices, circuits, and architectures is desirable. The energy and computational cost of AI has become a bottleneck for its applications in the real world. Research and education will be integrated through course and lab development. Under-represented and women students will be recruited for this project through the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, National Society of Black Engineers, and Society of Woman Engineers.<br/><br/>This project targets the development of new generative AI models with simpler designs and architecture than are currently available. A novel path is explored for designing deep-learning hardware accelerators via efforts that span from devices and circuits to architectures and algorithms. The Cellular Neural Network-based realizations for key operations in convolution-based networks is studied, because it allows the bulk of the computation associated with a deep generative AI model to be performed in the analog domain.  The development of mixed-signal circuits and architectures that lead to the best deep generative network designs by exploiting unique physics of emerging device technologies is investigated. The project is expected to generate orders of magnitude improvements in energy and delay for deep generative AI models, which will promote their applications and benefit the AI industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Technology is integrated into every aspect of today?s world; therefore, the education system needs to train students in the use of technology. Virtual reality is one method that can be incorporated as a part of the curriculum, as an instructional delivery system, an instrument to enhance the learning process, and a tool for evaluation. This project focuses on additive manufacturing and will leverage emerging technologies by using virtual reality to develop a bilingual (English/Spanish) immersive learning environment for engineering students. All students, including students with disabilities, will be given access to the cutting-edge learning modules within virtual environments. Additive manufacturing technologies play a critical role in future manufacturing; however, they pose high-level safety-related threats to workers and environments. Hence, workers who need to directly or indirectly work with these technologies must be professionally trained with hands-on experience to gain the specific certified skills needed. The learning platform developed during this project will transform traditional approaches of learning and teaching, and improve engineering education in additive manufacturing.<br/><br/>The proposed project includes four distinct activities: (i) development of a virtual reality learning platform, (ii) design of course modules, (iii) development of software to track students? interactions, and (iv) deployment of the developed software in the target courses. The learning platform will be a virtual additive manufacturing lab equipped with different types of 3D printers, a computer workstation, a station for hand tools, and a station for personal protective equipment. Students will be assigned operational or safety training projects, based on the printer chosen, with instructions to complete tasks in sequence. After the development of the learning platform and course modules, a pilot study will be performed to collect data on student interactions with the course modules. Students? facial expressions and eye movements will be collected in real-time along with their interactions with the learning platform and course materials. Data from this study will enable us to develop a model to design assistive functionalities within the virtual platform. This model can create useful feedback and additional instructions or question students? selections, substitute instructors? supervision, and provide assistance. The outcomes of this project will be a novel bilingual learning and teaching platform with real-time assistance to significantly enhance student engagement and performance in active learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Metallic lithium (Li) is considered as one of the promising next-generation anode materials to replace conventional graphite in Li-ion batteries because of its high theoretical specific energy capacity and low reduction potential. However, dendrite growth on the electrode and unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation have created safety concerns in Li batteries and hindered practical applications. Introducing an artificial protective layer on the Li metal electrode is an effective strategy to stabilize the Li electrode, yet how this protective layer interacts with the electrochemical process of Li metal anode is not well understood. This project will integrate experiments and simulations to understand how the physical and chemical properties of the protective layer affect the electrochemical performance of the Li metal electrode. The fundamental knowledge gained will guide development of novel Li metal electrodes with high performance and improved safety for electric vehicles and other high-energy-density electrical storage devices. The project will also involve the education of graduate, undergraduate students, and K-12 students by course development, summer camp, and outreach activities in local museums.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop a new understanding of the key physical and chemical properties of the protective layer that leads to stable charge/discharge processes of the Li metal electrode. The state-of-the-art guideline is insufficient, and the model only considers the influences of the limited mechanical properties of the protective layer on the stabilization of the Li metal electrode. In this project, by an effective integration of experimental synthesis, characterization and phase-field simulations, a new understanding will be generated on electrochemistry and deformation/failure mechanism of suppressing dendrites, including mass transport, electric potential, stress, and deformation. The research goal will be reached by working on several objectives: (1) Effect of mechanical properties of the protective layer on the suppression of Li dendrite growth; (2) Effect of ionic mass transfer behaviors of the protective layer on the stabilization of the Li metal electrode; (3) Novel protective layer on Li metal for the high-performance assembled cells. The elucidated correlation between physical and chemical properties of the protective layer, and the electrochemical processes of the electrode is expected to open pathways for the novel design and fabrication of Li metal electrodes, leading to stable and high-performance next-generation energy storage devices.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CBET Electrochemical Systems program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Liposomes are nano- and microscopic lipid bubbles that can be filled with DNA and injected into the human body to fix a defective gene. Liposome-mediated gene therapy offers promises for greatly improving therapeutic efficacy, but this promise depends on the quality of liposome DNA loading uniformity. Current methods for quantifying DNA loading uniformity in liposomes are cumbersome, time-consuming, and expensive. This work proposes a nanosensor technology that could quantify DNA loading efficiency on a single-liposome basis, providing improved accuracy in DNA dosage. Successful completion of this work will enable future gene therapy clinical trials to be more effective. The highly interdisciplinary nature of this research will generate excitement among students across a broad spectrum of STEM interests throughout the academic training and outreach programs.<br/><br/>The Investigators propose to design a bimodal optical-electrical nanosensor that utilizes nanopores to rupture liposomes and analyze their contained genetic contents. The proposed nanosensor, suitable for clinical settings, aims to quickly and accurately determine the encapsulation efficiency of circular DNA (cDNA)-loaded liposomes for gene therapy. The nanosensor features a double-nanopore architecture, with each nanopore serving a specific purpose: (1) An applied voltage bias will electrophoretically drive a liposome to the first silica (SiO2) nanopore, which has a smaller diameter than the liposome. The walls of the nanopore will exert a shear force, rupturing the liposome. (2) The released cDNA will then translocate across the second amorphous silicon nitride (SixNy) nanopore, verifying the presence of genetic material. Above the SixNy nanopore is a 100 nm gold layer with a double nanohole (DNH) architecture. A laser focused onto the DNH will optically trap the cDNA molecule immediately after translocating through the SixNy nanopore. While cDNA is held in the optical trap, the voltage bias will be reversed, removing the liposome fragments from the nanosensor. The optical trap will then be turned off, and a recapturing protocol will be applied to repeatedly translocate the cDNA molecule across the SixNy nanopore to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of optical-electrical measurements used to verify cDNA loop integrity. These measurements will quantify the fraction of liposomes that are empty, loaded with a single, intact cDNA, or with fragmented or multiple cDNAs. Importantly, the nanosensor technology has the potential to serve as an analytical tool for other soft nanoparticles, such as viruses and exosomes. Successful completion of this work will enable future clinical trials in gene therapy to be more effective, while also offering highly interdisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "An efficient, practical, and accurate numerical simulation method for turbulent flow is important in computational fluid dynamics for the study of tornadoes, hurricanes, aircraft design, and other turbulence-related areas. Due to the limitation of computation resources, it is hard to numerically resolve all-size vortices. Scientists have found that small-scale vortices have similarities although large-scale vortices are quite different. Large eddy simulation only resolves large-scale vortices and leaves sub-grid scales for modeling. Therefore, the accuracy of large eddy simulations is determined by the sub-grid models. The concept of eddy viscosity is still adopted in most practical turbulent flow simulations. However, most of the existing sub-grid models still use the resolved shear to calculate the eddy viscosity, which is inconsistent with the physics, especially in the shear-dominated regions like the laminar sublayer in turbulent boundary layers, where vorticity/shear is large, but eddy viscosity is zero. The inconsistency is caused by the misunderstanding that vortex strength is measured by vorticity. The remedy of using a wall function or artificial adjustment near the wall region cannot solve the consistency problem. Liutex is a new physical quantity exactly representing the direction and strength of a vortex or eddy. Previous direct numerical simulation has shown that Liutex has similarity in the dissipation subregion of the turbulent boundary layer, which paves the foundation for constructing a new sub-grid model by using Liutex.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a reliable and efficient Liutex-based sub-grid model for the large eddy simulation community. Liutex is a rigorous mathematical definition of vortex that correctly distinguishes fluid rotation and shear. The introduction of Liutex to extract the rigid rotation from the fluid velocity gradient is groundbreaking work in turbulence research. So, modeling small-scale vortices using Liutex instead of shear is very reasonable as eddy is vortex and vortex is Liutex. This project plans to (1) develop a new Liutex-based sub-grid model, (2) develop a new dynamic Liutex-based sub-grid model, (3) test new models in a variety of computational fluid dynamics cases such as backward step flow, S-duct flow, and flow around an airfoil, (4) evaluate the effect of new Liutex-based sub-grid model and compare it with other existing sub-grid models. The code of the new model will be provided to the community through GitHub. As large eddy simulation becomes one of the major tools of computational fluid dynamics, a breakthrough in the development of the sub-grid models will benefit almost all fluid-related research areas and engineering applications in multi-disciplinary research areas including aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, meteorology (hurricanes and tornadoes for example), bio-flow (blood flow and respiratory flow for example), astronomy (sun storm for example), etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "A multilayer network is a powerful and expressive mathematical tool for modeling and analyzing social, economic, biological, and technological systems. Informally, a multilayer network is a collection of related graphs. Applications of multilayer networks include understanding social networks, economic systems, online marketplaces, and detecting vulnerabilities in cyber-physical systems. While this research area is rapidly growing, there is a dearth of computational tools for analyzing large-scale networks from diverse applications. This project will develop the theoretical foundations and software infrastructure for analyzing very large multilayer networks on modern computing systems, thereby enabling their widespread use in diverse applications.<br/><br/>This project will develop NetSplicer, a collection of scalable high-performance algorithms for multilayer-network analysis. The approaches in NetSplicer will be based on a divide-and-conquer-like technique called network decoupling. Using decoupling, the multilayer network can be subdivided into multiple components, each of which could be potentially analyzed using known graph algorithms. Network decoupling seeks to address issues that are critical for multilayer analysis, such as reducing information loss and preserving structural and semantic information. The challenges in efficiently applying network decoupling include determining optimal decoupling strategies, preserving the structure and content of multilayer networks that have multiple vertex and edge types, and developing architecture-aware scalable algorithms that apply across different layers of a network. This project will provide a new capability for multiple research communities and will build a repository for multilayer networks. The planned collaborations with domain scientists from academia and industry, as well as curriculum development and outreach activities, will shape project development efforts to maximize impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "From the cars we drive to online banking, society has become increasingly dependent on software systems. As a result, software reliability remains an important problem to solve. One way developers can improve software reliability is by using software models, which allow developers to define the behavior of their software in the form of mathematical logic. Once a software system is modeled, various tools exist that automatically analyze the model for any issues with the software?s design. Unfortunately, software systems are not static: software is constantly getting updated as new features are added or requirements change.  As the system evolves, the software model also needs to be updated and re-analyzed. However, if the change to the model is small, this analysis can be largely redundant. This project looks to improve the efficiency of re-running different types of analysis over an updated model, which increases the feasibility for maintaining models of real world systems. The project involves preparing students for their careers by mentoring graduate students and connecting students to role models in the formal methods community, and the tools developed by the project will improve formal methods education.<br/> <br/>The project focuses on improving incremental analysis of Alloy models based on three ways users can interact with a model: writing a model, testing a model, and synthesizing a model. First, this project explores improvements to incremental analysis when writing Alloy models, which focuses on how to maximize reuse of past scenarios and how to minimize the new scenario exploration problem. This project investigates a suite of techniques that derive new reuse and exploration strategies based on what component of the model changed and seek to present the impact of the change to the user through disjoint categories of scenarios. Second, this project explores improvements to incremental analysis when testing Alloy models, which includes introducing regression testing to Alloy as well as leveraging first order logic to automatically generate high value tests that reason over the changed portion of the model. Third, this project explores improvements to incrementally synthesizing Alloy models by pausing the sketch to generate tests to refine the synthesis problem and by creating an incremental, parallel sketching environment. In addition to research papers, the project will produce open-source toolsets and benchmarks of incremental models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One is theoretical: What are design principles for an intersectional AI learning ecosystem? With this question the PIs explore Black girls' experiences with AI learning ecosystems, and how they can enact the constructs of intersectionality (critical reflection, action, accountability). Findings related to question 1 will help them develop a framework for intersectional professional development for AI professionals that is specific to how racial equity can be realized in AI learning; and, help them create new curricula that integrates AI; and, develop a framework for how to integrate PD, with curricula and technologies in AI spaces in order to create a more cohesive learning ecosystem. Research question 2 focuses on implementation: What are practical implementation guidelines for community organizations to integrate curricula and professional development into an intersectional AI learning ecosystem? The findings from this question will facilitate the development of resources for AI educators and community organizations. The findings from this project will be of interest to technology educators, AI professionals, the broader STEM education field, and community organizations that provide STEM education.  <br/><br/>This project is funded through the Racial Equity in STEM Education activity (EDU Racial Equity).

Its research builds on craft-based methods to design digital fabrication practices that allow users to maintain agency in the making process which has been shown to democratize access to advanced materials and fabrication techniques, enable grassroots innovation from hobbyist and professional communities, and broaden participation in STEM fields. Each research activity is situated within a community of practice and designed to engage REU students with stakeholders and peer researchers, including external mentors from internationally recognized human-computer interaction programs. Students will benefit from professional development in design thinking, additive and subtractive fabrication, and human subjects research. The interdisciplinary research experience and training will contribute to a high-demand research skill set for REU participants portable to a variety of science and technology disciplines.<br/> <br/>Projects will focus on a diverse range of underdeveloped materials within digital fabrication including clay, silicone, glass, biomaterials, and textiles which will provide both an experiential and collaborative learning substrate and attract underrepresented and underserved students in communities peripheral to science and engineering education. While a core advantage of digital fabrication is automation and abstraction, it has also contributed to removing users from directly interacting with a material. These material-based interactions are central to how experiential knowledge develops and are core contributors of creative cognition. Collectively, undergraduate researchers will help develop and disseminate digital fabrication toolkits and user interface systems to further promote material and technological literacy in both academic and independent \"do it yourself\" communities. Exemplar artifacts developed under the mentorship of professional art and design faculty will be disseminated through social and popular media and generate inspiration, excitement, and critical reflection around interdisciplinary collaborations between art and technology. Evaluation of the site using a Maker Competencies framework will provide valuable knowledge to the REU community on the effects of maker-centered training on the undergraduate research experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The Web has affected every corner of human life and society by providing the cyber-infrastructure to remove physical barriers between people. Myriad web database applications, including online recommendation systems, online shopping sites, location-based websites, resource-sharing platforms, social media, and service websites, have made people's lives unimaginably more connected, convenient, and cost-effective. The internal models, algorithms, ranking strategies, user profiling, and data resources shape the behavior of these web database applications.  Unfortunately, these can include unfair practices that propagate, or even amplify, historical biases through their services, products, and recommendations. <br/>This project aims to detect such unfairness and to correct it where possible.<br/><br/>A central question in detecting and correcting unfairness is how much knowledge can be assumed about these web systems' underlying data and algorithms.  It is unrealistic to assume full knowledge, and it is hard even to detect unfairness without such assumptions.  This project relies on making limited assumptions, such as the existence of a back-end database.  Based on these, the project will detect unwarranted bias, develop responsible design tools one can use to avoid inadvertent unfairness, and implement third-party tools to tailor responses to reduce disparities between different demographic groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Due to the proliferation of powerful mobile terminals, resource-demanding multimedia applications, such as video streaming, video calls, and online gaming, have been surging during the past decade. How to improve the satisfaction of these applications as perceived subjectively by end-users, widely interpreted as the quality of experience (QoE), is critical to the operators of wireless networks. Prevailing QoE enhancement methods are mostly operator-oriented, while users play somewhat limited roles. On the other hand, mobile devices are equipped with multiple embedded sensors that enable the collection and inference of rich contextual information. Motivated by these observations, this project aims to leverage user-centric context sensing to enhance QoE in wireless networks. The proposed user-assisted QoE enhancement, if successful, has the potential to serve as a promising complement to the existing centralized QoE management framework. Besides, it will open up new opportunities that incorporate mobile users for network measurement and management that has been mostly conducted by network operators alone. The project plans to engage female and under-represented minority students in the research activities and actively outreach to middle and high school students. The scholarly discovery will be disseminated broadly to the community.<br/><br/>This project intends to develop a practical framework to leverage context sensing for QoE enhancement and address critical challenges involved therein. More specifically, the proposed research will be carried out through three closely related research thrusts. The first thrust studies fine-granular user context prediction based on historical records harvested from mobile devices. As another key ingredient, it further investigates how to utilize the prediction results to assist with resource provisioning and QoE improvement in wireless networks. Realizing that context sensing may incur extra communication and energy overhead, the second thrust intends to reduce the cost by developing cost-efficient context sampling and accurate reconstruction that adapt to context dynamics. The third thrust addresses the privacy concern during context sensing. A flexible context trading framework will be developed to allow individual users to decide how much privacy to disclose in the trade of QoE improvement. The proposed research is inter-disciplinary, which spans resource management, learning techniques, compressive sensing, differential privacy, and economic theories. The proposed mechanisms and designs will be thoroughly evaluated via a combination of measurement campaigns, simulations, and experimental studies. A medium-scale prototype of off-the-shelf mobile devices, routers, servers, and cloud will be implemented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The dynamics of the fast plasma flows is an outstanding magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling problem associated with sudden magnetic field topology reconfiguration and explosive current formation, particle acceleration, and energy release in the magnetosphere. The simulation-observation results of this project will significantly deepen our understanding of magnetosphere-upper atmosphere coupling processes in the nightside transition region. Funds provided by this grant will promote two young researchers' professional development, including one postdoc. PI Dr. Zou, a female faculty member, will lead the team, mentor the early career scientists, and advise graduate students. <br/><br/>This project studies the dynamics of BBFs and their effects on the coupled MIT system using a two-way coupled global MHD-PIC model within the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) and comprehensive multi-instrument observations. Specific science questions to be addressed include: (SQ1) What are the particle velocity distributions associated with BBF? How do they evolve as BBF propagates earthward? (SQ2) How are the FACs distributed in the BBF dipolarization regions? Are their dawn-dusk asymmetries as suggested by recent theory? Can multiple BBFs and their wedgelets form the traditional SCW? (SQ3) What is the impact of BBF on the nightside IT system in terms of ionospheric density structures and airglow emission? The results of this project will be valuable to multiple new GEM focus groups and will also benefit the CEDAR community by deepening the understanding of the magnetospheric drivers that cause impulsive energy release into the IT system. The proposed activity will also enhance the scientific return of the NSF-supported radar facilities, AMPERE, and SuperMAG projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Non-volatile memory is a type of computer memory that can retain stored data upon a power loss or system crash. Due to its large capacity and low energy footprint compared to traditional volatile memory, non-volatile memory has long been envisioned as an ideal solution for building large-scale, cost-effective, energy-efficient, and recoverable applications in many critical domains, including high-performance computing, machine learning, and embedded systems. Although non-volatile memory is available as commercial memory chips and offers numerous promises, it has not yet been widely adopted in production systems. The major obstacle is the difficulty to ensure that data is timely and correctly written to non-volatile memory, allowing it to be restored to a consistent state after a crash. Currently, application developers carry the burden of porting legacy applications to non-volatile memory, which is tedious and error-prone. This project seeks to establish a generic framework for user-transparent persistence and crash consistency that allows unmodified legacy applications to run efficiently and correctly with non-volatile memory. The success of this project will help unleash the full potential of non-volatile memory and make it easier to adopt. The research will also provide valuable insights into data management in future hybrid, disaggregated memory systems. In addition, this project involves mentoring Ph.D. students, engaging minority students, course development, and K12 outreach activities. <br/><br/>This project integrates non-volatile memory into the page/buffer cache in memory management ? i.e., an abstraction that bridges the view of byte-addressable memory and a backing memory device -- to provide persistence and crash consistency to user-space programs with no or little user involvement. The challenges lie in 1) how to intercept program updates and redirect them to non-volatile memory for persistence; 2) how to properly order the updates and ensure update atomicity to guarantee crash consistency; 3) how to efficiently integrate non-volatile memory into page/buffer cache management without incurring noticeable overhead or performance degradation. This project addresses these challenges by focusing on persisting three types of program data ? file-backed data, dynamically allocated application memory, and program metadata for virtual memory management, such as page tables, and exploring various software and hardware techniques, such as copy-on-write, undo logging, shadow paging, and extended page tables, for each data type to achieve efficient crash consistency. This project advances the understanding of hybrid memory management for volatile and non-volatile memories while simultaneously achieving high usability, good backward compatibility, and high efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interactions among interconnected, communicating individuals facilitate collective intelligence, especially when people are engaged in a common goal or a shared practice. Recently, due to the tremendous increase in online attacks, there has been a substantial increase in both English and non-English social media posts in which people discuss the use of various safeguards to help protect their online security, privacy, and safety. This project is developing a framework and approach for capturing the emerging collective intelligence shared among groups of individuals who utilize social media platforms and who seek to use and follow safeguards to improve their online security, privacy, and safety.  Studying these discussions will increase our understanding of people?s security and privacy needs, detect the practical challenges and limitations of available safeguards, and shed light on the future direction of online security and privacy research. <br/> <br/>This project will develop a social monitoring framework and approach for detecting, collecting, and categorizing English and non-English social media posts and conversations around emerging security vulnerabilities, privacy threats, and discussions of safeguards for protecting people's security, privacy, and safety. The project will also advance existing information retrieval and natural language processing methods, including deep learning-based classifiers, sentiment, stance, and summarization in order to extract knowledge from English and non-English posts.

        "Abstract": "This project develops a theoretical framework that enables an analytical characterization of guidance laws for obstacle avoidance, accompanied by an experimental validation of these laws.  This has significant implications since the obstacle avoidance problem is an important component of the path planning problem, which appears in several diverse fields including robotics, autonomous air, ground and underwater vehicles, computer animation, molecular motion, autonomous wheelchairs, spacecraft avoiding space debris, robotic surgery, assistance aids for the blind, etc.  The guidance laws designed are particularly applicable for real-time implementation of precise path planning in cluttered dynamic environments such as those containing robot manipulators, humanoid robots, vehicles flying in formation and other high-dimensional spaces wherein the agents have no a priori information about their environment.  A robustness analysis of the designed guidance laws to various uncertainties such as sensor noise, data delays and data dropouts is performed, followed by an experimental validation wherein the guidance laws are coded on microcontroller platforms in a resource-efficient manner and implemented on small-scale robotic ground and air vehicles.  The expected results include guidance laws suitable for collision avoidance of obstacles of various, possibly time-varying, shapes moving in high-dimensional stochastic environments, along with a postulation of the safety guarantees of these guidance laws.  This project also performs multiple outreach activities and introduces new curriculum that promote the education and applications of robotics, and these activities are conducted in levels starting from K-12 all the way through undergraduate and graduate level engineering education."

        "Abstract": "Non-technical abstract: <br/>Living organisms use spatially controlled expansion and contraction of soft tissues to achieve complex three-dimensional (3D) shapes and movements and thereby functions.  However, reproducing such features in man-made materials presents scientific challenges.  This CAREER award aims to design and develop bioinspired 3D materials with programmed shapes and motions.  Stimuli-responsive, synthetic and biological cell-encapsulating hydrogel sheets (2D materials) will be encoded with spatially controlled expansion and contraction to transform the 2D materials into programmed 3D shapes through controlled deformation.  Biological organisms use such approaches for fundamental biological processes, including complex growth, movement, and adaptation to environments.  The proposed research thus has potential for fabricating bioinspired 3D materials that can change their 3D shapes in response to external signals, such as temperature, electric field, and light.  Such shape-changing 3D materials could find applications in various areas, including soft robotics, artificial muscles, biomedical devices, and tissue engineering.  Furthermore, this project will develop museum and summer camp outreach programs based on soft robotics activities to promote the interest of K-12 students in science and engineering.

In pursuit of this goal, this project will (1) design and prepare stimuli-responsive, programmable synthetic and cell-laden hydrogel sheets (2D hydrogels) and (2) develop a method to encode the 2D hydrogels with spatially controlled in-plane growth (expansion and contraction) using digital light projection lithography.  This approach will transform the 2D hydrogels into programmed 3D structures via out-of-plane bending deformation.  The resulting 3D structures will be able to reversibly transform between programmed 3D shapes in response to external stimuli, such as temperature, ion, electric field, and light.  This research will establish an integrated theoretical and experimental framework to design and create bioinspired 3D materials and program their 3D morphologies and motions, including how to encode cell-laden hydrogels with spatially controlled contraction to create shape-morphing 3D tissues with programmed motions.  Such capability will benefit many areas, including bioinspired soft robotics, artificial muscles, programmable matter, biomedical devices, dynamic 3D tissue models, tissue engineering, and biomimetic 3D manufacturing.  This project will integrate research and educational activities to (1) promote the interest of K-12 students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields using hands-on soft robotics activities through museum and summer camp outreach programs, (2) enhance research-oriented multidisciplinary education, and (3) develop the next generation of researchers in bioinspired soft materials, bioinspired engineering, and biomimetic 3D manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Solar flares, as the most intense eruptions of solar radiation, can cause enhanced ionization in the upper atmosphere on a global scale. This enhancement can impact aviation, maritime, and military communication systems and global navigation systems. However, our understanding of the flare-to-flare variations in the upper atmosphere is still illusive and thus prohibits forecasting capabilities. The results of this project will significantly deepen our understanding of flare-to-flare variations in the upper atmosphere and improve our predictability of the global upper atmosphere during solar flares. As Solar Cycle 25 is approaching its maximum accompanied by more frequent and intense solar flares, it is timely to carry out the research that will investigate the solar flares? impact on the upper atmosphere in detail. This project will be valuable in mitigating the impact of solar flares on aviation, maritime, and military communication systems and global navigation systems, which are critical for both everyday life and national security.<br/><br/>The overarching science goal is to investigate the evolutions of the global ionospheric total electron contents (TEC) during solar flares and to improve our ability to predict the responses of the global TEC to solar flares. Specific science questions that this project aims to address include: 1. What is the temporal evolution of the global TEC during solar flares? 2. How do the different phases of solar flares (e.g., coronal dimming and EUV late phase) impact the responses of the global TEC? 3. How can we predict the response of global TEC to solar flares using machine learning (ML) models? To address these SQs, the research team plans to utilize TEC data from the worldwide GNSS receivers, perform detailed analysis with an aim to investigate its responses to solar flares. The solar spectral irradiance during such events will be from empirical models (e.g., FISM2) or observations (e.g., SDO EVE). The investigation will use state-of-the-art physics-based numerical models (e.g., GITM) to investigate the responses of the TEC during different phases of solar flares, especially the EUV late phase and coronal dimming. The project plans to develop ML models to predict the global TEC responses to solar flares. To carry out the tasks, a team including experts in ground-based observations, numerical modeling, and machine learning would be involved in the research. The outcome of this project can help mitigate the impact of solar flares on our technological society. The project will support an early career researcher and promote integration of research and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The severity and cost of flood events continue to increase in the US, often with disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations who may have higher sensitivity to the negative effects of flooding and lower capacity to adapt. Understanding what makes communities vulnerable or resilient to flooding is critical to developing mitigation actions that can reduce the negative effects of future hazards. However, existing frameworks for assessing resilience often fall short, as they do not address important dynamic and highly localized factors that influence peoples? ability to cope with, adapt to, and recover from natural hazards. This Disaster Resilience Research Grants (DRRG) project will develop a bottom-up, community-driven framework for local-level resilience assessment by generating and utilizing high-resolution crowdsourced datasets and leveraging local knowledge and experiences to examine how the factors contributing to resilience (i.e., exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) vary over space and time. Findings will have implications for more effective resilience building. As part of the project, crowdsourcing efforts using Streetwyze, a community-driven mapping platform, will increase the awareness of flooding and its daily impacts in communities and will encourage diverse voices to participate in the collection of data to support local resilience planning efforts.<br/><br/>This project will use a mixed-methods, sociotechnical approach to examine how crowdsourced datasets can be leveraged to (1) improve the spatiotemporal characterization of factors that influence community resilience to flood disasters, (2) develop new metrics that account for the dynamic social and physical nature of resilience, and (3) encourage more equitable capacity-building to reduce the impacts of future floods and enhance disaster resilience across diverse populations. The project focuses on flood hazards in coastal Mississippi and engages with diverse community partners from flood-prone areas in the cities of Gulfport and Biloxi. Two novel crowdsourcing technologies that include passively collected mobility data and actively generated qualitative and imagery data will be used to characterize fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Surveys will evaluate how community members use the crowdsourced data and will assess the role of demographic and socioeconomic factors in influencing participation in the crowdsourcing effort. Geospatial, statistical, and machine learning models will be developed and applied to integrate the crowdsourced datasets with conventional sensor, satellite, and survey data. Model outputs will be used to develop novel measurement approaches that improve assessments of the factors contributing to community resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Why do some species dominate communities while others are rare? What determines such ecological success is a fundamental question in biology. Differences in species? specialization are often used to explain success. Species can either specialize on a few resources (e.g., one type of food), or employ a generalist strategy, and try to use many. However, a single species might specialize on one food type, but be a generalist in terms of the habitats that it?s found in. Because of this complexity it?s still unclear when a specialist strategy is beneficial. This project seeks to understand the conditions that favor specialists by examining lizard communities on islands in the West Indies. Sites in the West Indies communities contain one to eight species, with different species on each island. First the researchers will gauge how successful species are by quantifying lizard abundances. Second, they will measure lizard specialization with regards to their diets, the temperatures they tolerate, and the habitats they use. Third, the researchers will look to the evolutionary relationships between species, to assess how fast specialists evolve. Finally, they will measure how common food resources, temperatures, and habitats are. The research program will support undergraduate and graduate student training and promote science education in high schools. Further, it will explore new ways to communicate science by working with an artist to create art based on the research. <br/><br/>The role of specialization in determining ecological and evolutionary success has been long debated. Do trade-offs render generalists ?jacks-of-all-trade but masters-of-none??relegated to footnotes in ecological communities? Or, are specialists restricted to rare or less desirable resources, such that generalists are numerically dominant? Likewise, it is unclear how specialists evolve. Is niche expansion and contraction labile over macroevolutionary time? Or does the stage of a fauna?s evolution matter, such that during adaptive radiations early speciation events are more likely to produce generalists, with specialists only forming in late-stage, species-saturated communities? To answer these questions this research examines the Anolis lizard adaptive radiation in the Greater Antilles. The researchers use mark-recapture to quantify the structure of local communities on Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and two geographically distinct faunas on Hispaniola. Each islands? fauna is evolutionarily independent, but has nevertheless repeatedly evolved many species with qualitatively similar ecologies. The researchers will quantify ecological similarities by measuring the niche positions (e.g. most frequently used resource) and breadths (e.g. span of resources used) of each species along thermal, vegetation structural, and dietary axes. Doing so allows the researchers to test the hypothesis that niche breadth corresponds to dominance in ecological communities. By combining niche information with phylogenetic relationships, the researchers will then address how labile niche breadths are over macroevolutionary time. Lastly, the researchers will quantify available thermal, structural, and dietary niche space availability in each community and island to assess whether generalists are more successful in younger and less diverse communities with ample unused niche space. This project will provide novel insights into the ecological underpinnings of the evolution of specialization, testing long held hypotheses and offering insights into the generality of these hypotheses across evolutionarily replicated faunas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "With the rapid development of science and technology, vast amount of data has been and is being collected in nearly all fields of science and engineering for various practical purposes, such as medical data for advancing human knowledge in diseases and treatments to save lives, image data from the solar system and beyond for human's next frontier in space, and social network data for better understanding the society and economic developments. But to make these aims realities, data must be soundly analyzed to uncover what matters. While data analysis has been around for centuries, today's data is much bigger in amount and dimension and more complex, presenting notorious challenges to modern data analysis. Often real world data is noisy and conceals inherent hidden structures that can be concisely represented by graphs that use nodes for objects/events and edges for relations between nodes. Existing approaches rely on pre- and heuristically constructible graphs show their inability in handling nowadays complicated data. This project aims to change the status quo by developing novel mathematical models and efficient computational tools for scientists, engineers, and medical professionals who can use the models and tools to unearth the hidden structures to achieve scientific discoveries previously considered impossible. The principle investigators will integrate their research activities of this project with teaching and education, and will train undergraduate and graduate students in computational mathematics, data science, and interdisciplinary studies.<br/><br/>The proposed research will result in advanced models and efficient algorithms for graph-based machine learning. Two major distinctions from existing graph-based learning methods are (1) new models have a built-in probabilistic component that can robustly deal with high noisy data, and (2) a dynamic graph structure learning component that can uncover hidden graph structures concealed in real world data and yet not obvious enough to be pre- or heuristically constructed. The models have much wider applicability than existing graph-based learning methods because graph structure is now a variable that will be optimized over so as to yield an optimal hidden graph structure for a given data set, and the algorithms not only are capable of producing robust embeddings with simultaneously learned hidden graph structures but also will be made practical for big data through landmark and low-rank matrix approximation strategies. The proposed research will have potentially high impacts scientifically in areas where analyzing high-dimensional datasets plays critically important roles, such as data visualization, discovering structural patterns in computational biology, brain networks and other areas. The project will open up a new research direction in statistical machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This award will focus on enhancing the efficiency and resilience of manufacturing ecosystems by exploiting the advances in feedback-based autonomy and with fundamental understanding of materials and process physics. The current manufacturing paradigm treats the material processing stage (i.e., feedstock creation from raw ingredients) and the actual manufacturing stage (i.e., use feedstock to create final products) in a sequential and segregated manner. This sequential view results in a lack of system-level understanding which in turn adversely affects efficiency (production rate and product quality) and resilience (against material uncertainties and process disturbances). This project addresses this challenge by creating an interactive and integrated manufacturing ecosystem paradigm with a broadened system-level view ? aided by multi-disciplinary convergence of three disciplines: material science, manufacturing science, and control science. The research advances the science of manufacturing and strengthens the U.S. manufacturing ecosystem by developing computational models to understand materials-manufacturing interactions, and automation algorithms to enable efficient and resilient manufacturing. The research will be complemented by training of undergraduate and graduate students with special focus on underrepresented groups, multi-disciplinary educational material development, and tutorials and workshops for broader dissemination purposes.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop an understanding of the coupled nature of materials processing and actual manufacturing ? and the utilize this understanding to enable an automation framework towards integrated manufacturing ecosystem. The research objectives are: (i) quantification of the effects of raw ingredients on feedstock properties through an experimentally driven campaign, (ii) understanding of process physics with essential nonlinearities through a data-driven hierarchical modeling framework, and (iii) development of optimal control algorithms for coupled materials-manufacturing ecosystem. In the process, the following fundamental questions will be answered: (i) How to combine the knowledge of raw ingredients and their proportions to predict the rheological and physical properties of feedstock? (ii) How do the nonlinear interactions between feedstock properties and manufacturing dynamics impact the composite properties? (iii) How to formulate reduced order process models with acceptable computation requirements as well as enough physical insights? (iv) How to systematically combine knowledge of rheology and process physics and multi-modal data-stream to create an automation framework that ultimately enhances the feedstock quality in the material processing, and robustness of manufacturing environment? While the effectiveness of such a framework will be evaluated by using a laboratory-scale extrusion-based additive manufacturing system, it is anticipated that the framework can be broadly applied to any manufacturing systems as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The goal of this project is to investigate the integration of computational thinking (CT) into elementary school curricula by studying how teachers develop expertise in integrating CT activities that align with interdisciplinary standards and existing curricula. This project addresses the critical need for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) literacy by investigating effective models of professional development (PD) that improve STEM teaching and learning. Leveraging an asset-based approach, the project will provide opportunities to broaden participation in computer science education through building a community of practice for teachers and designing CT-infused curricula. To ensure that all teachers have the necessary support to participate in new pedagogical practices of increasing complexity, the project will utilize a collaborative teacher PD and mentorship structure in which teachers will work closely with peers and project team members to prepare, teach, and reflect upon lessons through multi-year participation. The research will document how teachers come to understand CT and take up these practices in their classrooms. The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of STEM by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Over four years, this project will directly impact 135 teachers in multi-year participation in professional development and approximately 12,000 students indirectly in their classrooms. This project will initially focus on schools in South Carolina, especially in rural districts. The project will be guided by three primary research questions: 1) How do preK-5 teachers integrate CT into their disciplinary teaching?; 2) What are the personal learning trajectories that teachers move through as they work towards CT integration?; 3) What are the barriers and accelerators for teachers? implementation of CT-infused lessons? This project is grounded in the idea that incremental, sustainable, and substantial teacher learning comes when teachers are fully invested in the cycle of learning and have opportunities to build and strengthen their communities of practice. In reflective PD sessions held throughout the academic year and summer, teachers will explore, co-design, implement, and refine student learning activities that integrate CT into existing content area standards and curricula. The CT activities, which will include standards-based lesson plans, assessments, and supplemental resources, will offer both plugged and unplugged components, so that students and teachers have opportunities to understand the conceptual underpinnings of computational thinking with and without computers. A minimum of 120 lessons and related pedagogical materials mapped to core-content standards will be developed and made freely available to the public on the project website. Using a mixed methods approach, this study will document the trajectories through which elementary teachers move as they begin to integrate CT into disciplinary teaching, as well as barriers and accelerators faced as they integrate CT into disciplinary teaching. Quantitative survey methodologies and multimodal analysis of narrative interviews, classroom video, teacher reflections, and pedagogical artifacts will be used to analyze teachers? sense making about CT over time and the uptake of new pedagogical approaches in their teaching. Ultimately, this study will produce a set of empirically-tested learning trajectories that can be used to support teachers in integrating CT into their classrooms. As a means of expanding the community of practice, sharing resources, and disseminating project findings to a nationwide audience, the project also incorporates a virtual PD component to support PD access to elementary school teachers from underrepresented and underserved schools across the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences capable of self-replication and mobility that often account for a substantial fraction of eukaryotic genomes. Despite their parasitic nature, it is now well documented that on many occasions the genes encoded by TEs, which normally facilitate their own propagation, have been \"domesticated\" to serve host cellular functions. The proposed work will test the general hypothesis that transposases are an opportune source of regulatory protein domains coopted because of their ancestral cellular interactions to build new genetic systems underlying developmental innovation and fostering organismal evolution. The PI will provide undergraduates, including minorities and first generation college students, with their first exposure to STEM research. The research and collaborations will guarantee that this functional genomics project will train rising scientists (graduate students and a postdoc) in cutting edge functional genomics technologies and data analysis.<br/><br/>The majority of domesticated TE genes known in a variety of organisms are derived from the transposase encoded by DNA transposons. The power of Drosophila genetics and genomics will be harnessed to begin the elucidation of the biological function of four likely independent domesticated transposase genes (DPLG1-4) and a set of proteins (MADFs) that are hypothesize to derive from the same TE superfamily.  These are highly conserved in the Drosophila genus and are derived from the same superfamily of DNA transposons (PIF/Harbinger) .<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
