        "title": "Collaborative Research: RUI: Direct and indirect effects of natural sounds on the structure of vertebrate insectivore communities",
        "abstractText": "Scientists have long explained where particular species of animals are found by examining what we, as humans, see in the environment. For example, we know that the type and density of plants affect where sparrows can be found. However, many animals rely heavily on non-visual senses, such as hearing, when interacting with their surroundings and deciding where to live. Although the acoustic environment -- what animals hear -- may be important to many species, it remains largely unexplored as a force influencing where animals can be found. This project will examine the extent to which natural sounds, such as those generated by wind and water, influence where animals settle, how they interact with one another and, ultimately, how they structure entire communities. Focusing on birds and bats, the investigators will conduct a large-scale experiment in which they place many speakers in the forest to create 'phantom' oceans and rivers -- the sounds of moving water without the water itself. This will allow them to figure out how sounds can change the way in which species interact with their environment and with each other. Specifically, this study will test how noise can explain where animals live, how they behave, and the extent to which they are impacted by human-made noise generated, for example, along major highways. This study will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate students at small universities and will result in an 'Acoustics in Ecology and Evolution' workshop to teach young scientists how to incorporate acoustics into their own ecological field research.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "Natural acoustic conditions have received little attention in their potential influence on ecological communities. Here, by broadcasting ocean surf noise in coastal scrub environments for three summers, we tested hypotheses related to how acoustic conditions shape animal distributions, behaviors, and interactions. We find that sounds of moving water cause several different bird species to alter their songs to cope with the difficult conditions for acoustic communication. Supporting this finding, we also find that birds have difficulty hearing songs of one another in the presence of sounds from moving water. Behavioral changes are common in other groups of animals as well. For instance, when exposed to sounds of moving water, ground squirrels become more visually vigilant for predators and forage less and move less than when they are not exposed to moving water sounds. Behavior of insects also can change with natural acoustic conditions. Females of the parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea eavesdrop on male cricket calls, then use the calls to fly near it to lay their larvae on or near the cricket, which subsequently burrow into the host to develop. In the presence of sounds from moving water, female flies have less success locating suitable hosts by eavesdropping on their calls, suggesting that ambient sound levels could influence broadscale patterns of parasitism risk for crickets. In terms of animal distributions, experimental broadcast of ocean sounds resulted in variable responses by individual species of birds and bats such that acoustics played an important role in structuring these communities. Many insectivorous birds that forage in shrubs or on the ground tended to avoid areas with higher sound levels whereas most aerial hawking bats became more abundant in louder areas. Foraging activity by birds also decreased strongly in areas exposed to higher frequency background sounds whereas small mammals increased foraging activity in all areas exposed to sounds of moving water. Taken together, our results demonstrate that naturally-occurring acoustic conditions represent an underappreciated dimension of the environment that shapes animal behavior and distributions. Incorporating this environmental dimension more broadly in ecology and evolution will provide stronger inference for both basic and applied questions. For instance, because the spatial and temporal footprint of human-generated noise is orders of magnitude greater than loud natural acoustic conditions, it is critical to understand that insights provided by our data increase the importance of keeping naturally quiet areas free of human-generated noise and mitigating noise pollution where it currently exists. Further embracing animal sensory worlds in research will help disentangle complex ecological patterns and expand our understanding beyond the boundaries set by our own sensory biases.",

        "title": "Collaborative Research: Miniature Low-Cost Vibration Tags and Computing Infrastructure for Identifying Marine Animal Sounds",
        "abstractText": "With the advent of large-scale marine passive acoustic studies it has become clear that the sources of the majority of biological sounds is not known. Knowledge of sound sources is important because sound can provide a robust measurement of biological activity, such as the distribution of spawning fishes, many of which like the cods and groupers are commercially important. It is very difficult to identify acoustic cues produced by fishes because many of them only make sounds during specific behaviors such as territoriality, aggression, courtship, and spawning and at night. Video technology has limitations in that it requires light and being in the right place at the right time. Innovative tags based on miniature accelerometers will be developed to capture sounds from marine animals. Newly recorded sounds will be deposited in the open, online infrastructure of the Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds, and the submission process will be streamlined to encourage similar use of this free repository. By creating computing infrastructure that enables sharing, this project will build a system that enables a self-sustaining community-driven solution to the science problem. These miniature tags will enable broader research into the motion of small structures and additional animals at minimal cost. This project will support the career of three young scientists and a postdoctoral research scientist.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "Public and scientific interest in underwater sounds has been rapidly increasing in recent years, yet most of the biological sounds recorded in oceans, lakes, and rivers are of an unknown identity. This project aimed to develop a new piece of technology in the scientific 'toolbox' of techniques that could be used to match fish species and the sounds that they produce. As an important part of the context of this project is identifying how many fish taxa have been documented to produce sounds. We found that nearly 40% of fish families have been documented or suggested to produce sounds, and these families include over two-thirds of extant fish species. Through evolutionary modeling, we also found that sound production appears to have independently evolved over 30 times in fishes, compared to the six times in tetrapods. This paper (Rice et al. 2022, Ichthyology and Herpetology) generated quite a bit of public attention and was picked up by many media outlets, including NPR’s Science Friday, The Guardian, the BBC, and over 70 news stories in media outlets around the world. This work provides an important intellectual foundation to identify which species are worth recording with different tags. Through this project, we were able to tag multiple fish and marine invertebrate species and detect sounds from these developed recording tags. As technology increases in sophistication and decreases in physical size, our efforts will lead to ongoing tag developments that expand the capabilities of scientists to record sounds from an ever-increasing number of aquatic species to understand the importance that acoustic communication may play in their life history.",

Previous attempts to understand animal communications relied on behavioral observations, and have studied only a handful of species given high costs. None of these attempts have adopted a computational and systematic approach to associate animal vocal sounds to written symbols and meanings as we typically do with human languages. This project investigates whether animals have languages that are syntactically and semantically compositional like humans, using current advanced machine learning methodology. In a preliminary study, the team has developed an 'animal language processing' pipeline that cleans and preprocesses a large amount of YouTube videos about domestic dogs, and further transcribes the audio segments of dog vocalizations into a sequence of phonetic symbols. In this project, undergraduate researchers will collect high-quality, partially annotated multimedia animal communication data, feed it into the aforementioned pipeline, analyze the resulting transcripts and gain new insights on the languages of new species. The work conducted by the undergraduate researchers will also develop into an open-source web-based animal language study platform called AniVoice.",

        "abstractText": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be in enhancing the well-being of chickens on poultry farms and in equipping growers with effective tools to monitor bird conditions. As chicken is a widely consumed source of live-animal protein globally, there is a growing consumer preference for ethically raised animals. The project addresses this demand by fostering improved welfare practices in poultry farming. There are collaborative movements with major producers and institutional consumers to establish evidence-based welfare standards impacting entire supply chain. With a declining agricultural workforce in the United States, it is essential to have automated mechanisms to extend a farmer?s capabilities. This project will develop a smart monitoring system for the birds meeting these needs, resulting in improved bird welfare and amplification of the farmer?s capacity.",

As the planet warms, it has become critical to understand how variation in temperature influences animal behavior and biodiversity. This project will investigate how temperature shapes communication\u2014a key behavioral interaction that drives animal diversity and influences species' vulnerability to environmental change. To investigate this multilayered question, the fellow will use a combination of physiological experiments, behavioral trials, and evolutionary analyses to examine how the effects of temperature on the production and function of mating signals have influenced the evolution of mating signals across North America. By integrating studies of how the environment affects basic physiology, behavioral interactions between organisms, and evolutionary change in communication systems, the project will reveal fundamental processes underlying global patterns of biodiversity and help us predict the effects of temperature change on animal physiology, behavior, and evolution in the future. Through student mentorship and outreach with partners at public and private institutions, the project will also broaden participation from diverse groups of students and trainees and promote environmental stewardship.<br/><br/>This project will investigate how environmental effects on signal phenotypes influence the macroevolution of signals across an extremely diverse genus of jumping spiders. The fellow will combine respirometry and courtship phenotype manipulations to understand how the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rates affects energetically expensive signal production and the outcomes of mate choice. By examining plastic and evolutionary differences in the courtship between populations found along replicated elevational gradients, these experiments will provide mechanistic insights into how local adaptation in the thermal sensitivity of communication can mediate sublethal breakdowns in reproduction and the potential for population collapse in the wake of climate change. Using leading-edge phylogenetic comparative methods, the fellow will then examine how this temperature-related plasticity biases the macroevolution of jumping spider mating signals across North American climate gradients.

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Global biodiversity loss can have cascading effects for dependent species so that declines in one species negatively impact the other. Seed dispersal is important in many plants, and they produce fruit to attract animals that spread the seeds. Yet, little is known about how plants respond to the loss of their animal dispersers. This project investigates the consequences of wild bird loss on the chilies (fruits) they disperse in the Mariana Islands. The introduction of an invasive snake species on the southernmost island (Guam) has decimated native bird populations; however, the snakes are not present on other islands, and these have native birds.  The research aims to improve understanding of how plant species respond to global change by comparing differences in fruiting on islands with and without birds. Further, by focusing on a culturally important plant in the Marianas, the fellow has excellent opportunities to provide outreach to communities already impacted by ecosystem change and accessible research participation and mentorship for prospective scientists in geographically isolated locations.  <br/><br/>This project aims to answer the following: Q1) In islands with varying seed disperser density, are there differences in frugivore visitation and fruit traits in wild C. frutescens populations? (Q2) What is the genetic and environmental contribution to fruit trait variation in Mariana C. frutescens populations? (Q3) How do individual C. frutescens from different island populations respond to low disperser activity? To approach these questions, the fellow will measure natural variation in physiological and chemical fruit traits in C. frutescens populations across the Marianas (Q1), grow individual C. frutescens from different islands in a common garden experiment (Q2), and assess the impacts of manipulated fruit removal rates on fruit traits of C. frutescens plants from different islands (Q3). The fellow will be trained in relevant fieldwork and chemical analysis techniques to conduct these activities, mentoring undergraduate students at the host institution and the Marianas to facilitate research. The fellow will also engage in outreach activities in the Marianas, including classroom presentations and informational booths at agricultural events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "Dr. Rachel Keen has been awarded an EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct research and professional development activities under the mentorship of Dr. Pamela Sullivan at Oregon State University. Woody plant encroachment occurs when trees spread in grasslands and savannas. Left unchecked, it can cause these areas to transform into forests. Trees and grasses look and behave very differently. When woody plant encroachment occurs, many changes occur aboveground that are obvious and easy to see. For example, there are more trees but less grass and fewer wildflowers. However, there are many changes occurring underground that are more difficult to see. First, trees take up more water from the soil than grass does. As a result, woody plant encroachment can cause the soil to dry out over time in some places. It can even reduce the amount of water flowing in streams. Trees also have bigger, deeper roots than grass. These roots can change how water moves down into the soil after it rains. Larger roots create channels that allow water to move deep into the soil more quickly. The goal of this project is to better understand how woody plant encroachment changes the amount of water in the soil. To achieve this goal, researchers will study four grassland and savanna sites in South Africa. At these sites, researchers will compare the amount of soil water in places covered by grass and nearby places covered by trees. They will then measure how dry the soil gets over time in these places. Soil water impacts the amount of water that ends up in streams and groundwater, and many animals and people rely on these water sources to survive. This makes it important to understand how woody plant encroachment could change the amount of water in the soil in grasslands and savannas. Data from this study will be used to make hands-on science activities for students in high school and college. Researchers in this project will also provide a short course designed to help graduate students succeed.<br/><br/>Vegetation forms a critical link between the atmosphere and the subsurface in terrestrial ecosystems, providing primary controls on water fluxes within the critical zone. Woody plant encroachment (WPE), the spread of woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) in historically grass-dominated ecosystems, represents a major shift in land-cover that is impacting grassland and savanna ecosystems worldwide and may result in substantial alterations to ecosystem-scale water cycling. A primary gap in our understanding of the ecohydrological impacts of WPE is the belowground change in rooting dynamics, and subsequent impacts on soil structure (i.e., creation of macropores) and hydrological processes (i.e., preferential flow) in grasslands and savannas. This study will quantify the impacts of WPE on (1) rooting distributions and soil structure, (2) seasonal wetting/drying dynamics and deep percolation of soil water, and (3) groundwater recharge. This study will take advantage of a natural rainfall gradient in northeastern South Africa to compare soil structural and hydrological responses to WPE at two mesic (mean annual rainfall > 1000 mm) and two semi-arid (mean annual rainfall < 550 mm) savanna sites. Plots will be established in encroached areas with high tree cover and adjacent non-encroached areas where tree cover remains low. Soil moisture time series (0-1 m depth) paired with time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging will provide detailed information on changes in infiltration dynamics and seasonal deep soil moisture in response to WPE. HYDRUS-1D will be parameterized with these data and used to predict changes in deep percolation of soil water and groundwater recharge in different locations and climate conditions. This project will advance the field of ecohydrology by improving our ability to understand and predict hydrological changes in response to WPE and uncovering the mechanisms behind accompanying changes in soil moisture and water yield. Beyond these advances, the data collected in this study will be used to create Data Nuggets, which are data-driven science lessons designed to give highschoolers and undergraduates hands-on experience working with data and asking scientific questions. A journal club-style course will also be developed for graduate students and postdocs aimed at \u2018demystifying\u2019 the hidden curriculum in academia, with the goal of making graduate school more accessible, enjoyable, and successful for a wider range of students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "Dr. Drew A. Levy has been awarded an EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to investigate slow earthquakes along continental fault systems and conduct professional development under the mentorship of Dr. Cailey Condit at the University of Washington. The research will characterize the type of earthquakes at continental plate boundary fault zones. Earthquakes along these fault zones occur in the top 15 km of the crust known as the seismogenic zone. Brittle fault rocks fracture and slip when stress is released as seismic waves. Deeper in the crust, rocks deform ductilely, and stress is released without creating seismic waves. This is called aseismic fault slip. Ductile fault zones move independently of the brittle part during rapid increases in slip velocity known as slow slip events. Slow slip events dissipate stress in the deep seismogenic zone. This may increase the stress on brittle faults above leading to an earthquake. Most observations of slow slip come from subduction plate boundaries. Similar phenomena have recently been reported in continental transform fault settings. Along part of the San Andreas fault in California, co-located seismic and slow slip events occur in the deep seismogenic zone. It is challenging to observe slow slip events with seismological instruments and GPS stations. We have a rapidly growing understanding of the physics that control aseismic fault slip during transient events. Discovering the rock types that experience seismic and slow slip events is important for understanding the seismic hazard of active faults. <br/><br/>This research aims to characterize the architecture and rheology of continental transform faults at the deep seismogenic zone, or the brittle-ductile transition, where major earthquakes nucleate through feedbacks between seismic and aseismic processes. Recent discovery of slow slip events (SSE) at major continental transform faults indicates our current models of the earthquake cycle do not account for slip and energy released through transient aseismic events. Using field and analytical study of an ancient transform fault system analogous to the SSE environment of the modern San Andreas fault, this project examines the significance of fault zone geometry and structure, lithologic and fluid-related heterogeneities, and temperature in controlling slip mode throughout the brittle-ductile transition. The methodology of this project is to test whether geological mechanisms of SSEs proposed for subduction zones are active in continental settings, and if the observed structures and deformation mechanisms can be related to predicted geological expressions of geophysically observed phenomena. The Norumbega fault system in the northern Appalachians of Maine, USA offers a natural laboratory for exploring deep to shallow levels of a fossil brittle-ductile transition zone. This research applies a field-based investigation of the geometry and structure of this ancient fault system, a high-resolution microanalytical examination of the microstructures and deformation mechanisms that accommodated variable slip modes, and an analysis of how the geological phenomena this study characterizes relates to geophysical observations of variable slip modes on active transform faults. This research will be translated into educational curriculum communicated through a video series on YouTube, which will feature the Dr. Levy and students working in the field and laboratory. This video series will focus on bridging the gap between STEM research and public understanding of geoscience. The student mentees and Dr. Levy will work in collaboration with the Rockin\u2019 Out, a K-12 outreach program in the Earth and Space Sciences department of UW, to develop modules on faulting and earthquakes related to this research for K-12 programs and help them be implemented in the Puget Sound area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Environmental stressors and immune challenges are increasingly common facets of life for every organism. How individuals, populations, and species respond to these challenges, particularly when they may have synergistic negative effects, can influence individual fitness and ecology, and ecosystem-level processes. Quantifying these responses across biological levels within individuals is critical to understanding the co-evolution of stress and immune systems in diverse taxa, as well as the impacts that synergistic stressors may have on populations and ecosystems. This project will holistically characterize this synergy from a molecular to a behavioral scale in an endangered and understudied vertebrate immune system through the integration of multidisciplinary data, including whole-tissue transcriptome data in particular. The results of this project can be translated for application to other vertebrate and even human systems to improve our understanding of how they/we respond to simultaneous stress and disease in an increasingly stressful and pathogen-rich world.<br/><br/>This project seeks to answer the question: do sublethal disease and anthropogenic stressors synergistically exacerbate stress responses and decrease immunity in marine reptiles, and if so, through what mechanisms? Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) commonly face an epizootic disease (fibropapillomatosis; FP) that causes individuals to present with tumors that can limit maintenance behaviors and reduce survival probability. Vessel-turtle interactions at developmental habitats can further impact fitness, energy expenditure, and resource acquisition, and physiological responses to these interactions might synergize with simultaneous immune responses to FP. This project will focus on juvenile green turtles at a high-use area near Crystal River, FL. Green turtles at this area face both FP and a putatively stressful increase in vessel activity during a 2.5-month recreational scalloping season. The fellow will use a range of approaches (e.g., passive acoustic monitoring, animal-borne data collection systems, RNAseq) to quantify vessel abundance and potential interactions, and any turtle physiological and behavioral responses. The fellow will compare data across four categories (FP positive or negative, before or during scallop season) of sampled individuals to determine if and how stressors and immune challenges interact synergistically in marine reptiles. This project will provide the fellow with experience generating and analyzing data to study integrative physiology and disease ecology, and will allow the fellow to provide training in core computer science skills to students and researchers from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Research that determines what causes this variation is critical in preventing and managing these diseases. The ticks that transmit these diseases to people feed on many different animal species, but rodents like white-footed mice and chipmunks are the most important in boosting tick numbers and tick infection.  Numbers of these rodents, in turn, depend on the supply of acorns and other tree seeds.  Weather and climate affect the trees, the rodents, and the ticks directly.  This research is designed to improve the ability to predict Lyme disease risk, which can have major implications for human health.  It asks how each stage in the complex life cycle of the tick responds to rodent numbers and to climate, how the rodents are affected by their predators, and how long-term changes in the forest, including the species and ages of the trees, affect the food supply for rodents and deer.<br/><br/>The research will collect new data on numbers and survival of both on-host and off-host ticks in the larval, nymphal, and adult stages and integrate these into full models of tick population changes through time.  It will ask how temperature and humidity on the forest floor affects survival of these life stages.  It will continue adding to a 30-year data set asking how the production of seeds by forest trees changes as the climate and relative abundances of tree species change over time.  The occurrence of predators such as bobcats, foxes, and coyotes will be monitored using camera traps to investigate possible impacts on rodents, ticks, pathogen prevalence, and Lyme disease risk.  The data will be used to develop and evaluate forecasts for Lyme disease risk from the component parts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "Webbed feet have evolved multiple times in swimming animals, including the well-known webbed \"triangles\u201d of duck feet. However, from pond dabblers to deep-sea divers, duck swimming ability varies considerably among species, and how foot anatomy contributes to this variation has yet to be investigated. This project will quantify duck foot shape by looking at both the skeleton and foot webbing. Then physical models of duck feet will be robotically actuated to directly measure how aspects of foot shape and paddling behavior influence swimming force production. The findings of this study will apply to numerous fields by inspiring designs of industrial, commercial, and robotic paddles (e.g., hydroelectric turbines, boat sails, scuba flippers). Further, by helping explain ecological and evolutionary patterns in birds, our results have the potential to inform conservation initiatives and paleontology research. In addition to the direct impact of these findings, a major goal of this project is to promote diverse future STEM researchers by supporting undergraduate biology students through their first research experience. Funding from this project will establish a professional development program (PDP) for 10 undergraduates per year. Each annual PDP will meet weekly over the summer of the first research experience and during the subsequent fall semester to build a supportive community for students while providing workshops that develop advantageous skills for future graduate studies or science careers.<br/><br/>More specifically, the first half of this project aims to identify evolutionary patterns in duck foot shape by measuring bone dimensions and toe splay broadly across duck species. Undergraduate students will analyze foot bones using CT-scans of duck specimens, including a visit to the Natural History Museums of LA County to choose specimens and learn about museum collections. Foot bone data will be coupled with shape analysis of webbed feet through photography and 3D scanning of collected specimens. Together, these morphological data will provide the basis for phylogenetic analyses to identify evolutionary patterns among species. The second half of this project aims to directly relate anatomical variation in foot shape to swimming performance. Informed from the measurements in the first section, students will construct 2D and 3D physical models of duck feet that vary in shape. These models will be robotically-actuated in a water flume while directly measuring hydrodynamic forces using force sensors and visualizing flow patterns using Particle Image Velocimetry. The project will initiate a productive collaboration capable of extending investigation into webbing material properties, complex paddling kinematics, and webbed foot diversity among non-bird paddling animals (e.g., frogs, aquatic mammals). The results will reveal a critical component of avian evolutionary history and provide a crucial framework for analyzing fossils of extinct dinosaur and bird species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow who will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research will delve into the deep-time record of amphibians to understand how they have been impacted by climatic shifts and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen that has driven devastating global declines in amphibians. To do so, the project will develop new genetic tools that will demonstrate how we can study the DNA of pathogens and their hosts across tens of thousands of years. Understanding the origin, ecology, and evolution of emerging pathogens like Bd is critically important, as the rising severity and incidence of emerging infectious disease events have profound impacts on public health, agriculture, and ecosystem resilience. Similarly, we can better respond to the current climate crisis if we can understand how climate-sensitive groups like amphibians have responded to past climatic shifts\u2014and how climatic shifts and past disease outbreaks may have interacted. The PI will additionally continue ongoing work focused on increasing the linguistic diversity of science and will mentor undergraduates in applied amphibian research.  <br/><br/>This project comprises three specific research aims alongside two broader impact aims. Firstly, the PI will design custom genetic baits to selectively enrich and sequence DNA from Bd and the amphibians it infects, even when highly contaminated and fragmented. Secondly, she will use the new Bd baits to genotype Bd from amphibian museum specimens in three geographic putative points of origin for the pathogen to discover whether the 1970s-90s Bd epizootics in amphibians can be attributed to the global spread of a new Bd lineage. Thirdly, she will deploy both Bd and amphibian baits on ancient sediment cores from each of the putative geographic points of origin for panzootic Bd to explore how climatic shifts and the arrival of novel Bd lineages have contributed to amphibian community turnover over millennia. Fourthly, she will continue working towards a more multilingual academy, including publishing on how publishing science in multiple languages affects the frequency and geography of citations. Finally, the PI will mentor undergraduates in characterizing where are when navigational apps may divert traffic directly over local, spatiotemporally specific newt migration routes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The relationship between Native American pastoralists and their animals has always been one of change and adaptation, even as it has provided continuity. This doctoral dissertation study investigates how and why a Native community\u2019s herding practices and perceptions of wellbeing are changing in the 21st century. The project centers Native people\u2019s perspectives and emphasizes the diversity of their experiences related to pastoralism to produce culturally relevant, empirically rigorous data useful to Tribal scientists, policy makers, and grassroots organizations working to support herders in pursuing wellbeing sustainably and in line with their varied aspirations. This locally focused work is a necessary complement to efforts and commitments at the federal level toward maintaining and enhancing Tribal prosperity, resilience, and self-determination in the face of changing, often challenging social, economic, and environmental contexts. The project trains a graduate student in methods of scientific data collection and analysis and builds capacity for the future conduct of scientific research in this context.<br/><br/>The objectives pf this doctoral project are to discover and explain (1) why some Native American herders persist in the practice of raising livestock despite numerous challenges while others opt not to herd despite this activity\u2019s traditional value and importance, (2) why some herders conserve a traditional livestock breed while others choose non-traditional breeds, and (3) whether and how subjective wellbeing is related to variations in conceptions of a life well lived and in herders\u2019 specific practices in pursuit of a good life. The study integrates semi-structured interviews, structured surveys, participant observation, and mixed-methods analysis. The research innovatively combines case-based causal analysis with ethnographic and quantitative methods from cognitive anthropology to advance understandings of (1) the crucial link between culture (defined as shared meanings) and action, (2) processes of social and cultural change, and (3) diversity in perceptions and practices of wellbeing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Bats navigate their surroundings by making calls and listening for echoes as they bounce off objects near them (echolocating). This project will investigate the behavior of echolocating bats in groups of bats by analyzing their echolocation sounds and determining how they adjust these sounds when around other bats. Echolocating bats can navigate completely dark spaces using their advanced sense of hearing to listen for weak echoes reflecting off surfaces, even when surrounded by many other echolocating bats. Understanding how bats accomplish this will help engineers design better sensing systems, such as autonomous sonar robots, that can perform in challenging environments involving interference and uncertainty. This will also further the understanding of group behaviors of multiple bat species, which can lead to better surveying and conservation efforts. The activities of this project will be leveraged to train students from diverse backgrounds in conducting research, and to support the fellow\u2019s service activities in scientific organizations to highlight the research of postdoctoral researchers from historically underrepresented groups and strengthen connections within the postdoctoral community. <br/><br/>This research involves recording groups of echolocating bats with synchronized arrays of ultrasonic microphones and thermal cameras. At least three species will be recorded at natural roosting sites: Myotis lucifigus, Myotis grisescens, and Tadarida brasiliensis. Synchronized acoustic and video data will be used to track the flight and echolocation behavior of the collective group and individuals within the group and determine whether individual bats dynamically adjust their echolocation (for example, their frequencies or emission rate) based on the presence of other echolocation sounds. These analyses will be used to build parametrized computational models of the sensorimotor behaviors of each species and identify similarities across species. This modeling work will enhance understanding of the behavioral heuristics used by individual bats taking part in collective group behaviors. To accomplish these goals, the fellow will conduct fieldwork, and build partnerships with a variety of organizations. Courses on deep-learning techniques will allow the fellow to gain the computational skills required for modeling echolocation behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "Many animals, including humans, communicate using elaborate gestures and body movements. Indeed, such behavior can mediate interactions related to courtship, competition, parenting, cooperation, feeding, and even predatory defense. However, despite the importance of this behavior to survival and reproductive success, as well as its ubiquity in animals, very little is understood about its mechanistic basis. This gap is perhaps largest with respect to the brain. The current project will provide the investigator with training in cutting-edge neuroscience technology that will test how particular brain regions contribute to the production of specialized gestural movements that mediate communication between individuals. The work itself will involve woodpeckers, which readily drum their beaks on trees to notify others of their territory in an attempt to maintain access to important breeding resources. Training that the investigator receives will greatly enhance his research program by allowing him to address a set of novel questions about how brain-level control of behavior is used for communication. Such skills will also elevate the investigator\u2019s ability to train future scientists (e.g., undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students) who are interested in exploring more about how the brain controls social behavior. More broadly, this project includes plans to support the development of STEM educational programming for limited English proficiency (LEP) high school students in the Rhode Island school system.      <br/><br/>Gesture and body movement are critical components of animal communication in a diverse range of taxa, yet little is known about how the brain controls such behavior. This project aims to uncover the neural basis of gestural communication, both in terms of gestural production and perception. To do this work, the investigator will receive rigorous training in cutting-edge neural electrophysiology techniques so that brain activity can be recorded in freely displaying animals, as well as animals that perceive such displays. The focal species will be downy woodpeckers, as these birds compete for territories by rapidly jackhammering their bills on trees in the environment. This is one of the most extreme gestural displays on the planet, and thus these birds make an excellent model to pioneer studies that explore how the brain controls this incredible behavior. Accordingly, this research will provide one of the first explorations of the forebrain system that controls discrete movements to facilitate drumming displays. This study will also compare the control of these movements to other non-communicative movements, such as basic locomotion or foraging. Finally, this research will work to establish how perceptual systems in the nervous system facilitate the appraisal of drumming. The auditory forebrain will be the focal point of perception experiments, and this work will provide a first look at how gesture-based displays might be assessed aurally by the brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) and the Linguistics programs. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Harold Torrence at the University of California, Los Angeles, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating complex verbal predicates cross-linguistically. Particle verbs, a type of complex predicate, have been extensively studied in Germanic languages like English. In these constructions, e.g. John picked up/out/on Mary, both the verb and the preposition/particle contribute to the overall meaning of the predicate. This project documents and describes particle verb constructions in four understudied languages in order to broaden the base of data that researchers use in studying an issue of long-standing complexity in linguistic research, namely, how the verb and preposition/particle work together to generate the overall meaning. <br/><br/>This project will advance scientific knowledge of verbal argument structures by undertaking the first detailed investigation of complex predicates in four understudied languages. The materials that it develops will provide crucial empirical data for syntacticians in testing hypothesis regarding complex predicate structures while enriching our understanding of the overall syntax of these languages. The training of student researchers will enable them to conduct research on their native languages, ensuring that ongoing high-quality research will be able to continue. Finally, it will expand knowledge of diverse languages with implications for American educators<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "This project studies the design and implementation of a new class of smart contracts.  Smart contracts are a kind of contract used in Blockchain, where a transaction is automatically triggered when the contract's conditions are met. Reliable and efficient smart contracts are essential for the robustness of any financial infrastructure and supply chains running on blockchain platforms. Errors in smart contracts have resulted in millions of dollars in loses. The project will enable global financial transactions to be carried out in a safe and efficient manner, benefiting mission-critical capabilities of secure supply chains and ensuring the delivery of goods such as medical products. The resulting tool will be open-sourced for widespread adoption.<br/><br/>This  project aims to develop DeSCO, a Declarative Smart Contract Optimizer that integrates novel optimization techniques and conventional database optimization strategies into designing and implementing efficient smart contracts. DeSCO will be based on Datalog, a declarative logic programming language. The declarative smart contract written in Datalog is then compiled into efficient Solidity programs for actual implementation. DeSCO is part of a trend toward adopting higher-level domain-specific languages with strong guarantees. Datalog frees programmers from low-level implementation details, allowing them to reason about the contract at the specification level via inference rules. The first thrust aims to extend the Datalog language to support domain-specific language features necessary for implementing complex smart contracts. Language extensions to be explored include support for complex functions, recursion and iterations, and event-based programming, amongst others. The second thrust explores techniques for synthesizing smart contracts from input/output example scenarios. The third thrust explores techniques for optimizing smart contracts via minimizing resource consumption. Cost models estimate resource consumption, inform novel single-query and multi-query optimization techniques, and reduce the likelihood of resource exhaustion attacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "This project is motivated by the way humans learn when collaborating. Collaboration between skilled human learners with diverse backgrounds is a primary way that new knowledge is generated when ground-truth information is not available. Collaborating learners should be skilled so that their contributions to the group are sound. The requirement that the set of learners is diverse is premised on the idea that the individual contributions of a single learner may shine light on things not known by another. For example, in cutting-edge scientific research, this situation arises when there is no known solution to a challenging problem. If an individual researcher cannot make progress, the researcher will tend to exchange ideas and collaborate with other researchers (sometimes from different disciplines). In this collaborative ensemble learning setting, individual learners inspire and gain knowledge from each other. We aim to do the same in this research for learning algorithms working together to solve problems. This project will directly promote undergraduate and graduate research and training; encourage participation from women and members of underrepresented groups; and impact Computer Science (CS) and non-CS curricula and courseware broadly and sustainably.<br/><br/>This project aims to emulate the benefits that a group of learners may get from collaboratively solving a problem together by learning from their combined output. The combination of pre-trained model outputs\u2014a practice known as ensemble learning\u2014has been well founded in methods like Bagging and Bayesian Model Averaging as a way to mitigate errors of component models. However, compared to the dynamic, mutually inspiring, and individually beneficial human collaboration process, current ensemble learning methods such as majority voting are often static and used as a last-step \u201cone-time deal\u201d for a small performance boost. The main idea of this work is that given a set of diverse pre-trained classifiers, their ensemble combined output can be a form of pseudo-label that the individual classifiers can learn from. These pseudo-labels can serve as a secondary optimization signal, especially when the primary ground-truth label signal is unavailable. The overall goal of this project is to use the diversity of knowledge present across a set of pre-trained models to compensate for the bias of any particular model and reduce average generalization error of all member models in the process. Additionally, if our ensemble prediction is given by the sample average over member model outputs, then our approach reduces the variation of the learning method by a factor of the number of models used in the ensemble and reduces the overall generalization error in the bias-variance decomposition of the ensemble expected test error. This project will provide important insights to both human learning (that is, education) and machine learning (for approaches such as Mixtures of Experts) with respect to multiple learning agents/models, with the benefits of improving not only overall performance, but also individual performance of participating models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Yeasts\u2019 simple body shape, and unique foraging strategies enable them to colonize habitats where few other organisms can survive, and where few scientists tend to search for fungi: such as within lichens, in streams and pools, and in high salt environments.  It is estimated that scientists have discovered only 1% of the yeast species thought to exist on earth.  This gap in knowledge of yeast diversity and distributions makes it difficult to understand the evolutionary history of the fungal tree of life, including mushrooms, medicines and symbionts upon which human livelihoods rely. Systematically collecting and describing these yeasts facilitates accurate identification of pathogens, and of the cryptic biological diversity comprising \u201cmicrobiomes\u201d that reside inside plants and animals.<br/>This project will focus on isolating and describing yeasts in the Basidiomycete class Pucciniomycotina, which are only distantly related to baker\u2019s and brewer\u2019s yeasts, and much less studied. The research will leverage the environmental diversity of Hawai\u02bbi, and the evolutionary diversity of zoo animals to maximize recovered yeast diversity from plant, animal, and environmental samples. The project will use a combination of genome sequencing, physiological data, and culture characteristics to publish formal descriptions and phylogenetic analysis of hundreds of novel species. The research will assess whether, and to what extent, yeasts co-evolved with their animal hosts.

        "abstractText": "In significant parts of the Earth for the past ~two billion years, soils have included a \u201cliving skin\u201d on the surface, made by tiny plants and microbes, and called a biological soil crust, or biocrust. Biocrusts are crucially important for helping to support the ecosystems they inhabit by making soil fertile, storing or redirecting water, and stopping erosion. Biocrusts also boost the diversity of living things present in an area. The CrustNet project will determine what controls the biological diversity of biocrusts around the world. Biodiversity plays an important role in helping ecosystems acclimate and/or adapt to changes in climate and land use, and it can help ecosystems recover after experiencing stress. Thus, a second goal of the research is to determine \u2013 in many different places \u2013 if the biodiversity present in biocrusts leads to more resistant or resilient ecosystems. This research will also provide data and tools to better predict the outcomes of climate and land use change on biocrusts, as well as the impacts on people that live in and rely on biocrust-rich ecosystems. In the process of conducting these studies, a global network of diverse researchers will be established. The project will also provide a unique training opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher. A documentary film will be produced about the project, shared online and shown at festival screenings to raise public awareness. <br/><br/>CrustNet will be a networked, distributed study of biocrust ecology, with participants distributed globally. Groups of researchers will conduct the same set of studies and collect the same types of data, which will then be pooled together to create an unprecedented global database about biocrusts. All contributors will participate in the preparation and publication of research products.  CrustNet will address: (1) determinants of global scale functional biodiversity of biocrusts; (2) determinants of the variability and shape of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function across ecosystems; and (3) effects of biocrust functional biodiversity on ecosystem resistance and resilience to physical disturbance and climate change. A tiered research protocol, including low-cost observational studies and manipulative experiments, will be deployed at many international sites. Tier 1 includes mandatory components such as detailed surveys of the composition of biocrusts, measurement of ecosystem functions along a biocrust development gradient, and contribution of samples to a trait database. Tier 2 includes low-cost experimentally-applied physical disturbance of the soil and subsequent tracking of the response of biocrusts. Tier 3 includes experimental climate manipulations using reciprocal transplantations and rainfall reduction using passive shelters. These experiments will be foundational to our understanding of determinants of biocrust diversity, function and response to disturbance.  Providing answers to these lines of inquiry will lead to new global insights, and the ability to compare biocrust microbial biodiversity with those of plant and animal communities. A postdoctoral researcher associated with the project will gain unique experience in international project management and coordination. Information about the project will be disseminated via a publicly-screened documentary film.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "Phenology is the study of recurring or seasonal natural phenomena, such as animal migrations and springtime flowering. Humans rely on predictable phenological patterns for our agricultural systems and seasonally dependent economic sectors that enable us to plan planting and harvesting dates for crops, anticipate disease and pest outbreaks, and attract tourists to take part in seasonal recreation. Natural ecosystems are similarly dependent on predictable phenological patterns. Minor disruptions in the timing of events, such as insect emergence or bud break, can impact species interactions and have significant consequences for ecosystem functions. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying phenological processes is critical for assessing and predicting impacts of climate change and informing policy and management decisions. This project analyzes data from the Campus Trees Project (CTP), a student-driven inquiry project at Michigan State University (MSU), and from USA-National Phenology Network (NPN), a nationally-distributed network of professional and citizen scientists, to better understand dynamics and trends in autumn tree phenology. In comparison to spring, much less is known about autumn phenological processes but shifts in the timing of autumn leaf color change and leaf fall can significantly impact a tree\u2019s potential to store carbon aboveground in woody tissue and belowground in roots and soils. This collaboration aims to contribute research about autumn tree phenology as a relatively under-studied phenological process and to build infrastructure that will support expanding the CTP to diverse educators and researchers collaborating to engage students in phenological research.<br/><br/>This work integrates and analyzes data from two long-term observational autumn tree phenology studies. The CTP is a robust dataset generated by students over seven years of an introductory biology course at MSU. The dataset focuses on a subset of local campus trees (n=120 trees) and embeds replication within species and across years to capture fine-grained data that demarcates specific autumn phenophases. USA-NPN data span species\u2019 entire geographic ranges and include larger numbers of individuals but with sporadic or low levels of replicate sampling. Research conducted in this partnership will contribute to gaps in the phenology literature about drivers of autumn senescence and compare findings within and among species at differing geographic scales. High-resolution CTP data hold promise for revealing trends in the specific timing and duration of distinct autumn phenophases (e.g., onset and duration of color change and leaf abscission) that are difficult to discern using other sampling methods. USA-NPN data, however, offer greater potential for detecting trends at larger regional scales. Data quality analyses will assess affordances and limitations of differing methodological approaches and inform protocol revisions that seamlessly integrate data between projects. USA-NPN is the premier source of phenology information in the U.S. and is used extensively in basic and applied research and in national and international assessments of climate change impacts. Partnering with USA-NPN expands the reach and impact of CTP data by leveraging their vast network of institutional partners and media and scientific outlets. Infrastructure developed in this partnership lays the groundwork for future projects that engage researchers, students, and educators as collaborators in autumn phenology research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Yeasts\u2019 simple body shape, and unique foraging strategies enable them to colonize habitats where few other organisms can survive, and where few scientists tend to search for fungi: such as within lichens, in streams and pools, and in high salt environments.  It is estimated that scientists have discovered only 1% of the yeast species thought to exist on earth.  This gap in knowledge of yeast diversity and distributions makes it difficult to understand the evolutionary history of the fungal tree of life, including mushrooms, medicines and symbionts upon which human livelihoods rely. Systematically collecting and describing these yeasts facilitates accurate identification of pathogens, and of the cryptic biological diversity comprising \u201cmicrobiomes\u201d that reside inside plants and animals.<br/>This project will focus on isolating and describing yeasts in the Basidiomycete class Pucciniomycotina, which are only distantly related to baker\u2019s and brewer\u2019s yeasts, and much less studied. The research will leverage the environmental diversity of Hawai\u02bbi, and the evolutionary diversity of zoo animals to maximize recovered yeast diversity from plant, animal, and environmental samples. The project will use a combination of genome sequencing, physiological data, and culture characteristics to publish formal descriptions and phylogenetic analysis of hundreds of novel species. The research will assess whether, and to what extent, yeasts co-evolved with their animal hosts. New insights into yeast diversity will be used to predict global species diversity, host/habitat specificity, and diversity hotspots. The project will increase the participation and research capacity of underserved groups (particularly Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders) via support for postdoctoral and student researchers, and formal training opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Aidan Short is \"Estimating the role of floral isolation in complex trait evolution and plant speciation\". The host institution for the fellowship is the University of South Carolina and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Carolyn Wessinger and Dr. John Kelly.<br/><br/>Floral isolation, or the evolution of combinations of floral traits that match the preferences of distinct pollinators, is hypothesized to promote the diversification of flowering plants due to the reduction of interbreeding between closely related plant species. In this research, the ability of floral isolation to contribute to plant speciation will be tested by first, estimating the evolutionary history of floral trait genes that contribute to divergent pollinator adaptation between two pairs of hybridizing plant species, and then, using theoretical modeling to estimate how floral isolation impacts levels of genetic divergence at floral trait genes and across the genome. The data and insights generated from this research will have implications for existing theories in evolutionary biology, agriculture, and conservation about the importance of pollinator adaptation and plant-animal interactions to the diversification of plant species. To promote diversity in the sciences, a chapter of the Alliance for Diversity in Science and Engineering will be established at the host institution. This chapter will be committed to inviting diverse speakers from various scientific fields to give talks at the host institution and neighboring K-12 public schools. Furthermore, to encourage students of various age groups and backgrounds to think scientifically and picture themselves as scientists, scientific outreach events will be organized at local K-12 schools.<br/><br/>This research will integrate empirical population genomic analyses and theoretical modelling and simulations to understand how divergent adaptation contributes to the maintenance of complex traits and promotes plant speciation. These goals will be pursued in three primary Aims. In Aim 1, genomic data will be used to estimate the strength and history of selection on floral trait loci between a pair of hybridizing plant species that display evidence of divergent pollinator adaptation. In Aim 2, genome wide variation in gene flow between two pairs of hybridizing plant species will be identified, and then the relationship between levels of gene flow and the strength of selection at floral trait loci will be estimated. In Aim 3, theoretical modelling will be used to estimate how variation in the strength of floral isolation (assortative mating and hybrid fitness) contributes to genome wide levels of divergence between a pair of hybridizing species. This research will generate novel molecular data (population-level whole-genome resequencing data) for pairs of hybridizing taxa from the genus Penstemon that display evidence of divergent floral adaptation and will integrate empirical and theoretical population genomics to identify how floral diversification has contributed to the diversification of angiosperms. Sequencing data and associated metadata will be deposited in the NCBI sequence read archive. Code for the performance of simulations and the analysis of genomic data will be uploaded to GitHub.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "This project will test how insect and microbial diversity affect the breakdown of dead animals. Decomposition of dead organisms is critical for controlling the recycling of nutrients in ecosystems. For example, this recycling process can affect soil health and plant growth. Decomposition of dead animals, or carrion, is a unique process because high-quality nutrients, such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, may be recycled for reuse by living organisms. Although carrion decomposition is important in natural systems, little is known about the ecology of this process. Some microbes and insects feed only on animal remains, but it is unknown how the diversity of these organisms affects decomposition rates. This project will provide insight into the role of insect and microbial diversity in controlling the fate of the estimated two billion tons of animal life on Earth. The results will help guide environmental management plans in a world of declining biodiversity. The project will also train undergraduate students through workshops on microbes.<br/><br/>To investigate the effect of insect and microbial taxonomic and functional diversity on decomposition rates of carrion, this project will use carrion mesocosms with four levels of insect species richness, from zero to three, in an outdoor, terrestrial field experiment. Each treatment will be replicated five times to capture a range of insect combinations within a block of four treatments. Further, the experiment will be replicated across three blocks to capture variation across experiment locations, for a total of sixty mesocosms. This research will take place at the Pineywoods Environmental Research Laboratory at Sam Houston State University, where carrion decomposer insects and microbes have been studied for over a decade. Insect functional traits, such as body size to tarsus size ratio, will be measured and included in Rao's quadratic entropy to estimate functional trait diversity of each mesocosm insect community. Carrion tissue and associated soil microbiomes will be characterized via amplicon sequencing over the key decomposition stages of active and advanced decay. Key microbial decomposer metabolic activity, which may be a functional niche unique to carrion decomposition, will be investigated via meta-transcriptomics. The contributions of insect taxonomic and functional diversity, microbial taxonomic and metabolic diversity on the ecosystem function of decomposition rate will be estimated via generalized linear mixed effects models. The results of this project will illuminate biodiversity ecosystem function relationships in an important, yet understudied system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "Humans are part of a rich global ecosystem containing vast numbers of different species of plants and animals. These highly diverse species interact in complex ways to fundamentally impact human life, health, and economy. Remarkably, most species on earth remain unknown to science. This is particularly true for small organisms, such as insects and fungi, that operate behind the scenes but have a fundamental impact on breaking down and recycling waste and on food production. Particularly given these critical roles, there is growing concern that global environmental change may lead to a reduction in biodiversity and impact which species occur where and how they interact. To reliably study such processes and obtain critical data for making policy decisions, it is imperative that automated methods are available for biodiversity monitoring. This project develops transformative new wireless communication and artificial intelligence (AI) tools for automating biodiversity data collection, processing, and analysis. These tools can be used to infer which bird, insect and bat species are present at any given location and time based on their vocalizations, while assessing relationships with factors ranging from climate to urbanization. The AI tools developed by this project will impact not just biodiversity research but many other fields across the sciences and industry. Young researchers involved in the project will receive training in developing and applying new AI methods in challenging settings. <br/><br/>This project develops novel AI methods and applies wireless communication technologies for biomonitoring. Under the ongoing biodiversity challenges, methods are needed for autonomously inferring which species are present in different spatial locations; such monitoring provides critical data for studying impacts of climate change and environmental disruption on biological community dynamics. Current data on biodiversity are heavily taxonomically and spatially biased. Scientists still know remarkably little about the dynamics of species communities, driving which species are present, the interactions among these species, and the impact of disruptions. There have been recent improvements in labor-intensive methods for biodiversity monitoring across broad groups of taxa, including birds, mammals, insects, and fungi. However, data collection remains very costly and requires substantial human intervention and management. Contemporary tools for species classification are error-prone; failing to account for these errors can lead to inaccurate scientific conclusions and flawed policy recommendations. Next-generation biomonitoring requires cost-efficient technologies for automatic, adaptive sampling and flexible inference to characterize and learn from ecological conditions in real time. This project develops transformative new tools for fundamentally improving biodiversity monitoring having immense societal and scientific impact.  Fundamental innovations include: (1) probabilistic paradigms to account for errors in inferring species composition from audio, imaging and DNA-barcoding data; (2) new classes of interpretable and identifiable AI-Joint Species Distribution models to characterize how community composition is driven by biotic and abiotic factors; (3) improvements in wireless communication technologies for remote monitoring; and (4) adaptive designs to optimize allocation of limited resources to maximize learning of ecological community dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "The Urban Biodiversity Futures Research Coordination Network (UBF RCN) brings together scholars and practitioners to address the interlinked challenges of biodiversity conservation, climate resilience, and social justice. Urban areas are increasingly recognized as important sites for biodiversity conservation, and cities are investing in urban green spaces for their ecological benefits as well as their benefits for human well-being. At the same time, urban green spaces are not distributed evenly across or within cities and climate change is creating an emerging challenge for urban biodiversity efforts. The UBF RCN is nurturing transdisciplinary conversations that engage scholars from diverse disciplines along with urban practitioners to synthesize knowledge and build a research agenda that captures the range of questions, hopes, and concerns at the intersection of urban biodiversity, equity, and climate change. In addition, an important goal of the project is to train the next generation of scholars who can work across disciplines and collaborate with community partners. The project is providing educational and professional development opportunities for upwards of 20 graduate students and early career scholars. <br/><br/>While there is a mature body of research in both the natural and social sciences that interrogates urban biodiversity in increasingly nuanced ways, there are few transdisciplinary collaborations that deeply examine what biodiversity in the city means, how it functions for different groups of humans and nonhumans, and what it may take to produce equitable, just urban conservation in a climate-changed future. The UBF RCN responds to this need by building a multi-disciplinary community of scholars and practitioners to reconceptualize urban biodiversity, envision a transdisciplinary research agenda to understand and support just, resilient urban biodiversity conservation, and equip scholars and practitioners with the language and skills for interdisciplinary collaboration. To do so, the investigators are hosting place-based workshops annually, supporting the coordination of interdisciplinary conference symposia and collaborations, providing training and mentorship for graduate students, and developing a web-based community. The findings and data are being disseminated in and beyond the four host cities and to multiple scholarly communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "In significant parts of the Earth for the past ~two billion years, soils have included a \u201cliving skin\u201d on the surface, made by tiny plants and microbes, and called a biological soil crust, or biocrust. Biocrusts are crucially important for helping to support the ecosystems they inhabit by making soil fertile, storing or redirecting water, and stopping erosion. Biocrusts also boost the diversity of living things present in an area. The CrustNet project will determine what controls the biological diversity of biocrusts around the world. Biodiversity plays an important role in helping ecosystems acclimate and/or adapt to changes in climate and land use, and it can help ecosystems recover after experiencing stress. Thus, a second goal of the research is to determine \u2013 in many different places \u2013 if the biodiversity present in biocrusts leads to more resistant or resilient ecosystems. This research will also provide data and tools to better predict the outcomes of climate and land use change on biocrusts, as well as the impacts on people that live in and rely on biocrust-rich ecosystems. In the process of conducting these studies, a global network of diverse researchers will be established. The project will also provide a unique training opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher. A documentary film will be produced about the project, shared online and shown at festival screenings to raise public awareness. <br/><br/>CrustNet will be a networked, distributed study of biocrust ecology, with participants distributed globally. Groups of researchers will conduct the same set of studies and collect the same types of data, which will then be pooled together to create an unprecedented global database about biocrusts. All contributors will participate in the preparation and publication of research products.  CrustNet will address: (1) determinants of global scale functional biodiversity of biocrusts; (2) determinants of the variability and shape of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function across ecosystems; and (3) effects of biocrust functional biodiversity on ecosystem resistance and resilience to physical disturbance and climate change. A tiered research protocol, including low-cost observational studies and manipulative experiments, will be deployed at many international sites. Tier 1 includes mandatory components such as detailed surveys of the composition of biocrusts, measurement of ecosystem functions along a biocrust development gradient, and contribution of samples to a trait database. Tier 2 includes low-cost experimentally-applied physical disturbance of the soil and subsequent tracking of the response of biocrusts. Tier 3 includes experimental climate manipulations using reciprocal transplantations and rainfall reduction using passive shelters. These experiments will be foundational to our understanding of determinants of biocrust diversity, function and response to disturbance.  Providing answers to these lines of inquiry will lead to new global insights, and the ability to compare biocrust microbial biodiversity with those of plant and animal communities. A postdoctoral researcher associated with the project will gain unique experience in international project management and coordination. Information about the project will be disseminated via a publicly-screened documentary film.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project addresses these threats by synthesizing data from NSF-funded studies on pathogens like West Nile virus, avian influenza, and MERS-coronavirus. By integrating these data with recent community initiatives, the project will create a comprehensive and interoperable database accessible through an online portal. By leveraging a data-driven approach combining ecology, data science, and mathematical modeling, the project will generate actionable knowledge for public health strategies and policy-making. Emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration and cultural exchange between the US and UK, it will enhance global pandemic preparedness. The study will lead to new understanding of how diseases emerge and spread, which is crucial for predicting, preventing, and managing future outbreaks. The findings will be made available through user-friendly web dashboards, ensuring accessibility for scientists, policymakers, and the public, ultimately contributing to improved health and welfare for human and animal populations.<br/><br/>The goal of the study is to integrate knowledge from two decades of research, advancing understanding of pathogen dynamics, generating actionable knowledge for disease prediction, prevention, and management, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. Published data will be reviewed for consistency in format, variable names, and metadata, and then harmonized for interoperability with repositories such as EID239, GLOBI40, and the Verena dataverse. The harmonized data will be archived in Dryad and Figshare, ensuring long-term preservation and accessibility. Additionally, a sophisticated web interface will be developed to enable interactive exploration and analysis of the datasets, providing tools for visualization, filtering, and cross-referencing data points. A conceptual framework will be introduced to guide future research in the macroecology of emerging diseases and pandemics, enabling statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and predict disease emergence. This framework will serve as a foundation for interdisciplinary research, facilitating collaboration across fields such as epidemiology, ecology, data science, and public health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "Dr. Jacob Wilson has been awarded an EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct research and professional development activities under the mentorship of Dr. Tyler Lyson at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and Dr. Blair Schoene at the Princeton University. Humans have started a biodiversity crisis on the Earth that is likely to cause high extinction of many organisms in the near future. Scientists can add to our understanding of this crisis by studying the past. In Earth history there have been at least five major events where extinction was greatly increased. These are called mass extinctions. The most recent mass extinction was ~66 million years ago. This event is known as the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) event. From research on the K/Pg, we know that it caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (except birds) and led to the rise of many groups of mammals that are around us today. Scientists have also studied many other organisms from the time of the K/Pg. One gap in our understanding is freshwater fish, which today represent one quarter of living animals with a backbone, with over 18,000 species. Despite how many of them there are today, what happened to freshwater fish during the K/Pg extinction remains a mystery. PI Wilson\u2019s research will include field work to find and study fish fossils from sites in the western United States. One of these is a unique site in central Colorado that has a layer of rock from the event that killed the dinosaurs. PI Wilson will also study chemicals in rocks to test whether a famous site in North Dakota is from the \u2018day the dinosaurs died.\u2019 Together, this work will use full fossil skeletons down to the tiniest pieces of bone to study what happened to freshwater fish when the dinosaurs went extinct. The results of this research can help humanity to face the conservation challenges of the current crisis. As part of these studies, PI Wilson will work with community volunteers and local high school students in the Teen Science Scholars program at the Denver Museum and undergraduate students at Princeton University. Through museum exhibits, interactive video conferences, and in-person discussions, PI Wilson will share his research with the public, including students and museum patrons of all ages.<br/><br/>This work will consist of four projects chosen to both contribute to our understanding of freshwater fish diversity dynamics around the K/Pg and also to build and curate valuable datasets of use to the wider scientific community. The first project will expand collections of microfossils in critical stratigraphic sequences from the unique West Bijou study area of Colorado to provide high-resolution information on post-K/Pg recovery in the Denver Basin. PI Wilson will then use CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb geochronology to date volcanic ash horizons from West Bijou and build a timescale of recovery that will serve as a temporal framework for scientific study of the K/Pg. Description of several articulated specimens from near-K/Pg sediments across sites in the western United States will provide insight on alpha diversity in freshwater ecosystems of the time and will contribute to our understanding of lineages that perished from or survived the K/Pg event. Finally, a preliminary analysis on the presence and age of zircons from the Tanis locality will provide a much-needed independent test of the working hypothesis that the site was deposited by seiche activity in the Western Interior Seaway in the immediate aftermath of the K/Pg impact. Together, PI Wilson\u2019s work will integrate information from different analytical disciplines to expand our understanding of the K/Pg event and the ongoing \u2018sixth mass extinction\u2019. PI Wilson will mentor high school students interested in STEM careers through the Teen Science Scholars program at the Denver Museum. The ongoing \u2018After the Asteroid\u2019 exhibit at the museum will be an outlet to share his research, and he will further communicate with students of grades 4\u201312 around the USA as part of the Scientists in Action program. At Princeton, PI Wilson will work with local K12 science teachers to facilitate communication of cutting-edge research to students and will mentor undergraduate researchers in the Department of Geosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "Continental rifting leads to the formation of economic resources and deposits, influences the distribution and evolution of plants and animals through changes in topography and habitats, and impacts global climate by volcanic outgassing of carbon dioxide. The East African Rift serves as a modern example for many of these processes. However, even in this modern setting, the timing and rates of development of the mountains and valleys that characterize the rift remain poorly understood. Lake Tanganyika is the largest lake within the East African Rift, but the age of the lake and the timing of uplift of the adjacent mountains are debated. This debate, in turn, impedes understanding of the timing of rift evolution, rates of erosion and sedimentation, and the pulse of speciation and diversification of the organisms living in the lake and watersheds. The project\u2019s goal is to constrain the timing of rift initiation and fault magnitude along the Lake Tanganyika portion of the rift to understand how rifts grow, the timing of lake formation and variation in erosion and sedimentation rates. This project will also produce maps of nearshore habitats along the lake, providing critical decision-making information for NGO\u2019s, such as the Nature Conservancy, and local scientific units, that are actively considering the location of protected areas around the lake. Finally, this project will initiate new collaborations among the US and international researchers and both present and future research and teaching will benefit from cross-fertilization of ideas, methods, and means of analysis developed during this project. <br/><br/>This project involves creating a spatially extensive analysis of exhumation and denudation along the Lake Tanganyika (LT) rift to infer timing of rift initiation, model erosion and denudation, and explore the role of tectonic exhumation and denudation on watershed morphology.  The specific objectives of this research are to 1) use low-temperature thermochronology (apatite fission-track and apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He analysis) to determine timing, rate and magnitude of tectonic exhumation along discrete footwall blocks of the LT rift; 2) use cosmogenic nuclide analysis (10Be) of quartz-bearing sediment to determine catchment-wide denudation rates of catchments that drain footwall blocks of varying size and tectonic style; and 3) analyze variation in river and catchment characteristics, using well-established quantitative tools, along the targeted footwall uplifts of contrasting tectonic style to examine transient changes in watershed geomorphology and footwall uplift induced by faulting and/or surface processes. Using the combined datasets, the researchers will test different hypotheses on the timing of rifting in the LT portion of the EAR, and test various models of normal fault growth, linkage, and controls on erosion and delivery of sediment (rates, texture and composition) to the basin sink.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "This REU Site award to the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2025- 2027. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students who are early in their undergraduate career and primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group will be trained in the program. The program has a strong history of preparing students for advanced degrees in the biological sciences, with approximately 70% of our graduates pursuing Masters and/or PhD degrees in life sciences. Students will be fully immersed in their research mentor\u2019s laboratory to learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of this program will be done through an online tool. Students should apply to the REU site using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov).<br/><br/>The Biological Discovery in Woods Hole program provides a rich undergraduate research experience with a focus on daily, hands-on, independent experimentation in the mentor's laboratory. The program focuses on the neurobiological and/or cellular processes that regulate physiological systems and/or mediate organismal behavior. To augment the research experience, students participate in weekly course meetings, field trips, seminars, and luncheons that explore a wide range of topics (graduate school application to ethics) to encourage the students to prepare and pursue a career in the biological sciences. Students will present research posters during the MBL undergraduate research symposium at the end of the summer. Applications will be made through the NSF ETAP portal beginning in December of each year and will be reviewed by the admissions committee, with decisions made in early spring. Recent undergraduate projects have included lamprey nerve regeneration, how glial cells influence nerve regeneration, heat stress on corals, RNA editing in squid, anthropogenic sound on marine organisms, ion regulation in nudibranch gills, embryonic development in skates and cephalopod camouflage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The fellowship supports the research and training of the fellow who will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Coral reef ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots that offer immense economic benefits through fisheries and ecotourism. Photosynthetic algae live inside coral tissue in a mutually beneficial endosymbiotic relationship essential to coral survival. Rising ocean temperatures disrupt this endosymbiosis in a deadly phenomenon known as \u2018bleaching\u2019 wherein the colorful photosynthetic algae are expelled from the coral, leading to ecosystem collapse. Over the past several decades, ~50% of the world\u2019s corals have been lost. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying coral bleaching, preventing the development of successful amelioration actions. This research will benefit society by elucidating symbiotic mechanisms using genetic and biochemical techniques to better understand coral bleaching. <br/><br/>Upon symbiosis formation, algae enter the animal tissue from the environment and reprogram host biology to live within coral cells. A key question in the field is to identify genetic factors that regulate the formation of endosymbiosis and its breakdown due to heat stress. In this research, the fellow will develop a protocol to isolate and purify symbiotic cells at different stages of algal infection. The proteome of these cell populations will be characterized by proteomics to determine host factors that change upon symbiosis formation to identify key regulators. Next, these putative regulators will be tested using cell biology and functional genetic methods to find those necessary for symbiosis formation. Finally, the fellow will characterize the conservation of these proteins across reef-building corals to determine the core regulatory mechanisms of symbiosis and study the role of these regulators during heat stress and bleaching. In addition to the fellows\u2019 research goals, they will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science as a BioEYES teacher in Baltimore, MD, to teach genetics and developmental biology to K-12 students. The fellow will additionally develop and teach modules for BioEYES that are tangential to their research on coral bleaching and ocean conservation to cultivate interest in biological sciences and spread awareness on ocean health decline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "One of the most dramatic examples of climate change is the bleaching of coral reefs worldwide. Many corals harbor photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae inside their gut cells giving them a brown color. Coral bleaching is caused by the breakdown of this symbiotic relationship and photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae are either expelled or voluntarily leave the safety of coral host cells.  Host cells benefit from the symbiont photosynthate (food) but host cells have to make decisions on which symbiont cells can live inside their own cells and which cannot (self-nonself recognition).  Corals are endangered and difficult to work on in the lab, so the researchers have developed an experimental model for coral bleaching, the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana.  Cassiopea is an ideal system to explore the concept and maintenance of self-nonself relationships during the establishment of stable photosymbiosis because their gut cells take up the same algae that corals do, and Cassiopea can be easily raised in the lab throughout their entire life cycle.  This project uses optical imaging and single cell sequencing to follow the cellular and molecular responses of both host and symbiont in the establishment of stable symbiosis.  Of particular interest is how the symbiont molecularly \u2018hijacks\u2019 the host innate immune system to avoid intracellular digestion. Gene regulatory networks for both host and symbiont will be generated at time points spanning the initiation and generation of stable symbiosis in both \u2018good\u2019 algae, and nonsymbiotic cells. This work provides molecular and cell biological insight in to how to rebuild healthy coral reefs. The results from this work will be incorporated into the education and outreach program and provide insight into how to rescue coral reefs in the wild.<br/><br/>One fundamental challenge in biology is to understand how novel cell types arise and how the this leads to the evolution of biological complexity. EcoEvoDevo is the field that embraces how environmental influences- including symbiosis- affect developmental processes. This project investigates the environmental induction of a novel cell type, the amoebocyte, by a photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae during the development of the upside-down jellyfish, Cassiopea xamachana. Amoebocytes arise from Cassiopea gut cells that phagocytose an appropriate species of dinoflagellate to set up a stable intracellular photosymbiosis, withdraw from the endodermal gut epithelium and adopt a mesenchymal phenotype in the mesoglea.  Amoebocytes form only after stable photosymbiosis have been established, and their presence is required to complete the Cassiopea life cycle. The upside-down jellyfish, Cassiopea xamachana is an ideal system to explore the concept and maintenance of self-nonself relationships during the establishment of stable photosymbiosis and the environmental induction of a novel cell type, the amoebocyte. Cassiopea has several favorable properties over all other cnidarian photosymbiotic models including the ability to complete the life cycle in the lab, procure ample embryological material daily, quantify symbiont growth rates, outstanding genomic resources and favorable optical properties. This work will use FACS sorting, Next Generation sequencing, and lightsheet microscopy approaches with fine time scales to generate gene regulatory networks for both host and symbiont during successful and unsuccessful host-alga interactions.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by Symbiosis, Infection, and Immunity (SII) and Plant, Fungal, and Microbial Development (PFuMiD) programs in BIO-IOS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or who are from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, will participate.  This program will focus on recruiting domestic students from minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, and community colleges. Students will learn how laboratory research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of this program will be done through an online tool.  Students should apply to the REU site using NSF ETAP (Education and Training Application: https://etap.nsf.gov).<br/><br/>Research within this REU program will focus on using Microscopy to understand Form and Function Across Biological Scales (MicroFFABS). Each student project will incorporate microscopy into innovative biological research. All REU participants will gain exposure to microscopy methods (e.g., fluorescence, super-resolution, etc.) using state-of-the-art instrumentation with applications to questions that cross multiple scales of biological research. Potential projects with mentors in the Biology and Physics departments include investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning neurodevelopment; identifying the connections between form, function, and environment in animals that interface with and attach to surfaces; examining mechanisms driving plant responses to climate change; elucidating mechanisms of protein quality control to understand the assembly and disassembly of biomolecular condensates; and understanding how cells self-organize and develop. Students will participate in a broad range of professional development workshops including the responsible and ethical conduct of research, as well as training in advanced microscopy techniques and post-processing practices and interpretation. Students will be expected to present their work in a campus-wide poster session at the conclusion of their research experience. Online applications are evaluated and program directors of the REU program make a final ranking of the finalists. Offers will be extended via email to the top-ranked candidates until the 10 positions are filled.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "There are numerous examples of biologically inspired robots that mimic features of animals and plants, and many can operate in natural environments. However, the overwhelming majority of these devices are rigid, inorganic, and created from toxic and/or non-biodegradable materials; they are in many ways the antithesis of the organisms that they mimic. Roboticists often cite tasks in natural environments \u2013 forests, oceans, farms \u2013 as quintessential examples of the broad utility and future of robotics. However, operation in any of these environments is impossible or highly impractical if the robots performing these tasks cannot autonomously return \u201chome\u201d. Furthermore, failure of any individual robot would require human intervention or result in environmental contamination by a \u201cdead\u201d robot left behind. This project will develop \u201cliving materials\u201d that can be composed to create biodegradable robots that operate autonomously in natural environments. At the end of a task, the devices remain in place and degrade into harmless or useful substances. The development of biodegradable living materials represents the next phase in robotics, ushering in new capabilities for environmental monitoring and remediation; infrastructure inspection, long-term monitoring, and repair; environmental exploration, including locations otherwise difficult to access such as deep ocean and remote ecosystems; and biomedical robots for internal medicine and wearable assistive devices. The materials and experimental focus of this project will also facilitate structured hands-on learning experiences for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. <br/><br/>The current reliance on a classical pallet of engineering materials is more of a hindrance than an enabler for the future of robotics, in particular for fulfilling the promise of autonomy in natural environments. More traditional robot architectures are fragile and expensive, leading to conservative design, control, and deployment strategies, highly limiting the scope of use and impeding the achievement of science-fiction-like tasks in natural terrestrial or aquatic environments. Furthermore, all such devices must be collected at the end of their operational lifetime, raising additional challenges for full autonomy. This program focuses on robots created from \u201cliving\u201d materials that embody function in soft biodegradable composites. These materials will perform a desired task and, at the end of the mission, simply remain in place and degrade into benign or potentially beneficial substances. This concept represents a paradigm shift for how we can think about autonomous devices operating in unstructured environments, relaxing more typical control goals and guarantees since device failure would be inconsequential or potentially even useful. This vision motivates research into materials chemistry of new artificial muscles, new architectures for electrical and chemical energy storage and conversion, materials-based methods for controlling the distribution of energy and sequencing of actuation in a programmed manner, and multi-scale multi-material fabrication strategies for creating biodegradable composites that embody these functions. This project will conclude with demonstrations of heterogeneous collectives of biodegradable synthetic \u201cliving\u201d robots autonomously performing tasks including assisted agriculture and environmental remediation, and subsequently degrading in place.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Companies localize their product ads to boost sales. In line with this, the project aims to study how well a machine grasps cultural nuances for communication. In particular, it will focus on language tools' potential to seek common ground across cultures. The new idea is to make these tools not just about words but also about the culture behind them. This paradigm shift will open the door to endow language tools (e.g., a chatbot) with cultural competence. This, in return, will benefit the users of these tools to enhance mutual understanding and break the cultural gaps.<br/><br/>The technical aims of the project are divided into two thrusts. The first part is to design a new knowledge base to bridge cultures by learning from human experiences. The project will collect raw data from crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Wikipedia). It will then bridge cultures via human-in-the-loop design. Building on top of this knowledge base, the second part will develop new tools to diagnose large language models (LLMs). The project will focus on capturing the rationale behind LLMs' success and failures in connecting to cultures. Next, the project will design and develop novel interpretation techniques. Based on the findings from this project, the project team will provide proposed guidelines for LLM improvements.

        "abstractText": "This EAGER project explores the use of multiple cameras to record three-dimensional (3D) videos of social interactions and dialogues in American Sign Language (ASL). ASL is the third most used language in the United States, after English and Spanish. There are 500,000 deaf, deafblind, and hard of hearing (DDBHH) signers, and far more who learn ASL as a foreign language in school or college. DDBHH people experience many educational, workplace, linguistic, health, economic and social disparities. There is a critical need not only for more data but also better data about use of American Sign Language by individuals, groups and communities across diverse communication settings such as home, health or the workplace. Communication and social interaction among people who use ASL is hindered by a lack of three-dimensional video about DDBHH signers\u2019 communication and interaction in these settings. This research is expected to have strong benefits and impact how people communicate with DDBHH signers.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to pool institutional resources for both equipment and personnel to create larger, more systematic 3D video datasets of social interactions for collective use by researchers and community members. This research establishes an infrastructure to collect this critical data that can be shared. This consolidation of resources, including pooling of resources and personnel, can eliminate the time and resources that individual researchers spend on compiling small, idiosyncratic, one-off datasets for their personal use. The pooled data will be higher quality and more durable, and facilitate reproducibility and replication of key research results, leading to better, more reliable science and to leverage these datasets to build the intellectual, social and developmental capital for the DDBHH communities and American Sign Language.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "Access to comprehensive knowledge about diseases, conditions, and medications is not only empowering but also essential for the public to understand complex medical information, leading to better personal well-being. However, current medical information sources, such as Google Knowledge Graph, often have limited scope, primarily covering a small subset of well-known diseases. Public data sources like academic papers on uncommon diseases are not well-structured or easily understood by the general public. This project aims to create a flexible and open-resource medical knowledge base called FORMED, providing multi-faceted information on a wide range of diseases and conditions for public access. This knowledge base will include well-structured sections on symptoms, causes, and treatments, enabling efficient disease classification and indexing. By integrating medical knowledge with individual health records, the project will also evaluate its effectiveness in predicting individual health risks for uncommon diseases. Additionally, this project will involve educational initiatives such as developing new courses on large language models; conducting interdisciplinary research activities to train graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students in data science and bioinformatics; and increasing participation of women and minority groups in academic research. All core outcomes of this project, including software, datasets, and publications, will be made available to the general public.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is twofold: (1) to create a public-oriented medical knowledge base called FORMED, covering a wide range of diseases, conditions, and medications in the current disease classification system with descriptive attributes including symptoms, causes, and treatments; and (2) to develop a temporal health outcome prediction and generation framework to evaluate the generated knowledge base with individual health records. This project creates a set of technologies for semi-structured text generation, knowledge graph construction, and mixed-structure temporal data prediction as well as generation. Specifically, the research activities include: (1) Developing hyperbolic embedding-enhanced domain-specific large language models for building FORMED; (2) Constructing a knowledge graph from FORMED to represent the logical concepts of disease characteristics and causes; (3) Designing novel learning and prompting strategies to augment the reasoning capability of large language models with knowledge graphs; and (4) Building a robust testing platform to evaluate the effectiveness of the generated knowledge graph for forecasting individual health risks. The establishment of comprehensive medical knowledge bases will significantly enhance public understanding of uncommon diseases and improve the inference capabilities of generative models, enabling searching-based services. Research outcomes of this project will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications, tutorials, seminars, and workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "High-quality water is needed for sustaining all life on Earth. Different types of pollution, however, can reduce water quality and harm the plants, animals, and people that depend on water to live. Specifically, recent wildfires across the U.S. may reduce water quality in several ways. For example, ash from wildfires can end up in lakes and rivers, potentially harming aquatic organisms and drinking water supplies. In this project, a group of researchers will study water quality of northern Minnesota lakes after the 2021 Greenwood Fire. This wildfire burned a large part of Superior National Forest in fall 2021, including areas near 28 lakes. The researchers expect that after spring snowmelt or rain, ash and large pieces of burned plants will wash into these lakes and reduce water quality. They will visit lakes five times from spring to late summer of 2022 to document any water quality changes following the Greenwood Fire. Results of this study will help water managers in Minnesota and elsewhere predict how water quality in lakes and reservoirs may change after future wildfires. This project will also help people who live near lakes understand how the water activities they care about, such as fishing and boating, may be affected by future wildfires.<br/><br/>Although wildfire activity is increasing across the U.S. and concern is mounting over fire effects on water resources, few studies have documented fire effects on lake ecosystems. At 10844 ha in size, the 2021 Greenwood Fire in Superior National Forest was the largest lightning-caused Minnesota wildfire in 10 years and covered all or parts of 28 lake watersheds through October 2021. This project assembled an integrative group of aquatic ecosystem, landscape, and fire ecologists to study the physical, chemical, and biological responses of northern Minnesota lakes to the Greenwood Fire. The researchers hypothesized that (1) lake responses will vary proportionally to the percent watershed burned and between drainage vs. isolated lakes and (2) post-fire temporal trajectories will vary according to major hydrologic events (e.g., snowmelt, precipitation). Both hypotheses are being tested using Bayesian approaches (i.e., information theoretic modeling and model choice procedures). Approximately 15 lakes are being sampled each in (1) burned and (2) unburned control watersheds beginning after spring snowmelt, a critical time for the delivery of nutrients and materials from the burned landscape to lakes, and throughout summer 2022.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "      Wildfires represent both an important historical process for maintaining prairies and forests and a potentially major disturbance to lakes and streams. While wildfires are most commonly associated with the Western US, the Midwestern US has a long history of wildfires, including in lake-dense, northern forested regions of the Upper Great Lakes. Wildfire frequency and severity are increasing as a consequence of changing climate. Therefore, wildfires may represent an increasingly important disturbance to northern forested lakes in the future. This project sought to better understand how lakes in this area respond to wildfires by studying a population of 30 lakes (15 in burned watersheds, 15 in unburned watersheds) located in or nearby the 2021 Greenwood Fire burn area (10844 hectares), a lightning-caused wildfire near Isabella, MN. Study lakes were selected to represent a range of wildfire burn size and severity (for example, 1% to 91% of watershed burned). Lakes were sampled monthly from May-September 2022, the year following the wildfire, for a comprehensive suite of water quality variables.   Intellectual merit of our study was building important new knowledge about how wildfires affect lake health. Previous wildfire-aquatic ecosystem research has largely been conducted on streams and rivers in the western US, but lakes in the Midwestern US may not show similar responses due to differences in geology, hydrology, climate, and vegetation. Our studys combination of location (Midwestern US), large scale (number of lakes), and sampling frequency (monthly from late spring to early fall), as well as our inclusion of lakes in watersheds ranging from minimally burned to nearly fully burned made it unique. To implement our study design, we sampled 30 lakes (15 in burned watersheds, 15 in unburned watersheds), which represents the largest study of lake responses to a single wildfire in North America. Further, we sampled lakes monthly during the ice-free season to investigate how wildfires affected seasonal water quality patterns in lakes; previous studies typically sampled lakes once during the summer.   Our research findings showed that lakes in burned watersheds had consistently greater amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon and were considerably murkier compared to control lakes (unburned watersheds). Interestingly, increases in nutrients did not lead to increases in algae production, potentially due to increased water murkiness and insufficient light. In lakes with burned watersheds, total phosphorus was the only variable that significantly increased with increasing percent of the watershed vegetation undergoing a high severity burn. Increases in total nitrogen and carbon responded most to the percent of the shoreline that burned, but the response was not significant and leveled off. Lake and landscape factors generally explained more variability in the water quality responses than burn severity, but the fire variable with the strongest explanatory power was the percent of the shoreline vegetation that experienced a high severity burn. Monthly differences between burned and unburned lakes persisted for most of the water quality variables except pH, which was similar across all lakes. Taken together, our study demonstrated considerable impacts of wildfire on lake water quality throughout the first year following fire, with more severe burns near lake shorelines leading to the greatest effects.   Broader impacts of our study include improved knowledge to support lake and forest management decisions, especially concerning responses to wildfires, and training opportunities for students and early career scientists who will be responsible for mitigating impacts of wildfires on forest and lake health in the future. Our findings showed what fire, lake, and landscape characteristics cause the biggest lake water quality responses to fire, which can help lake managers target limited funding to lakes most at risk of water quality degradation. By showing that high-severity burns near lake shorelines had the greatest impacts on lakes, our findings will help forest managers improve fire risk mitigation activities, such as the placement of prescribed burns and mechanical thinning, to reduce the impacts of wildfires or prescribed burns on waterbodies. For workforce development, this project directly supported two early-career scientists (PhD degrees) and one nontraditional undergraduate student (Bachelors degree), helping to retain them in the sciences as they explored permanent career pathways. Additionally, our project team benefited from working with excellent early-career or undergraduate women in STEM (1 PhD degree, 1 Bachelors degree, 4 undergraduate students), who received critical professional development opportunities because of this project.

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Multicellular animals share common signaling pathways that are responsible for patterning and regulating development in early animals (embryos) all the way to adults. One such pathway is called the Wnt signaling pathway, and its study has been instrumental to our understanding of cell-cell communication, animal development, stem cell biology, and cancer. Wnt pathways have been well studied, and a \u201ccanonical pathway\u201d is the best understood. However, there are non-canonical functions of the Wnt pathway as well. This research aims to integrate genomic tools and the attributes of butterfly wing patterns to determine how Wnt signals instruct pattern formation in these wings. Furthermore, the fellow will take advantage of butterfly biology's natural appeal to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in life sciences. Specifically, (1) creating a Spanish-language active learning module for bilingual schools, (2) providing summer internships to two high-school students per year with the sponsoring scientist Dr. Arnaud Martin. (3) Encouraging the participation of diverse scientists at the postdoctoral level.<br/><br/><br/>Butterfly wing patterns are visually compelling, two-dimensional arrays of differentiated cells where signaling outputs from the tissue are directly translated into color patterns. Preliminary data from the fellow's Ph.D. work and the sponsoring lab proposes that the conserved WntA molecule organizes discrete domains of color-forming scale cells, potentially independently of the canonical Wnt pathway. Hence, the fellow will generate a laboratory colony of the butterfly Junonia coenia deficient for the WntA protein; then, she will survey how WntA presence/absence impacts gene expression and chromatin accessibility during wing development. Those data will provide a genome-wide landscape of the cellular responses to WntA signaling, which the fellow will use to select candidate genes for specific assays:<br/>visualizing mRNA and protein in the developing wings (i.e., immunochemistry), and CRISPR/cas9 gene knock-outs. The fellow will formally test the non-canonicity of WntA signaling and tackle the molecular mechanisms that mediate signal integration and result in sharp cell specification domains, as observed in the sharp boundaries that delineate color patterns. This original work will be important for a comprehensive understanding of Wnt signaling and may shed light on novel aspects of the pathway that could extend across the animal kingdom. In this proposal, the fellow will work with outreach programs, training and mentoring of future scientists, and develop a networking group for Latin-American and first-generation graduate students and postdocs interested in EvoDevo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Project Outcomes Report: Decoding the Secrets of Butterfly Wing Patterns   Butterflies, with their enchanting and intricate wing patterns, have captivated scientists and nature enthusiasts alike. In this project, a postdoctoral researcher embarked on a fascinating journey to unravel the DNA information that governs the specification and regulation of spatial details determining wing color elements.   The primary objective was to utilize butterfly wing patterns as a unique model system to explore the mysteries of cell signaling, focusing specifically on the Wnt family of genes. The researcher delved into understanding their function and their regulatory impacts on the formation of butterfly wing color elements. This endeavor not only aimed to deepen our knowledge of butterfly biology but also sought to shed light on broader questions related to the evolution of cell signaling.   The journey involved studying the gene expression of Wnt genes during the development of wings in larvae and pupae. Additionally, the researcher manipulated the gene expression of canonical Wnt signaling candidate genes using advanced genetic tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 and Dicer-Substrate Short Interfering RNAs (DsiRNAs).   In the genomics aspect of the project, the researcher optimized genetic perturbations to induce contrasting effects related to WntA gene expression, generating the gain and loss of wing elements distinct from the wild-type phenotype. This system was used to explore changes in gene expression and DNA chromatin accessibility during the early pupae development stage, providing new insights into the establishment of individual elements that collectively compose the intricate arrangement of butterfly wings.   Beyond the realm of butterflies, the implications of this project extend to broader scientific inquiries. Understanding the intricacies of cell signaling in butterflies contributes to our knowledge of a fundamental biological process. Moreover, the insights gained may find applications in various fields, including genetics, developmental biology, and evolution.   Throughout this captivating journey, the postdoctoral fellow aimed to engage students in the wonders of scientific exploration. Leveraging the universal appeal of butterfly wing patterns, the project served as a bridge between the scientific community and the broader public. The fellow shared knowledge by conducting interactive workshops on single-cell sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 in the USA and Latin America, in addition to presenting the investigation results in national and international meetings.

For example, 'again' in 'I won again' suggests that it was already established that the speaker had won previously. A hallmark of presuppositions is the fact that they are preserved under logical operators like negation: a sentence like 'I didn\u2019t win again' continues to suggest a prior victory. The issue of how presuppositions interact with their surrounding context \u2013 how presuppositions project \u2013 has been a central and hotly debated topic in the study of natural language meaning. This dissertation project aims to contribute to this debate by examining presupposition projection in sentences where theories diverge. The project approaches this empirical terrain from an innovative angle, turning to online processing and child language acquisition, which can shed new light on the logical and inferential systems that underlies human semantic competence. The project includes the training and mentoring of undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>The project will carry out a series of psycholinguistic experiments with adults and children, with the goal of distinguishing between two classes of theories: (i) theories that predict that the presuppositions of conditionals and conjunctions should vary based on the position of the presupposition-carrying expression, and (ii) ones that predict uniform presuppositions across the board. Study 1 probes adults' real-time processing of presupposition projection, with the goal of identifying behavioral signatures of presupposition projection. Study 2 turns to child language, where the influence of confounding pragmatic factors is minimized. Finally, Study 3 probes in more detail how other, non-linguistic factors influence judgments about presuppositions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "      Human languages allow us to distinguish the main point of an utterance from background information taken for granted, or 'presuppositions'. For example, a speaker uttering 'I won again' treats as an established and uncontroversial fact that they had won previously, while intending to convey that they won a second time. A key question in the study of presuppositions is how they 'project', that is, how presuppositions get inherited when embedded in more complex structures. This project used experimental and developmental methods to probe the behavior of presuppositions in conditionals like 'If I win again, there be a party'and disjunctions like 'Either I will win again, or there won't be a party'. A set of studies were constructed to examine how adults and children treat such linguistic constructions. Using novel experimental methodologies, we found processing data from adults suggesting that presuppositions project differently from the left and right arguments of conditionals and disjunctions, providing empirical support for a class of theories that predict asymmetric projection. Experiments with children revealed that as early as 5-years of age, children have acquired adult-like patterns of presupposition projection, filling an empirical gap in our understanding of how this dimension of meaning develops.   More broadly, this project contributed to the broader agenda of understanding the inferential systems that underlie meaning computation, which are key not only to human intelligence, but also could inform the development of next-generation artificial intelligence. The project contributed to cross-disciplinary discussion among linguists, developmental psychologists, and philosophers through two conference presentations. In addition to supporting a doctoral dissertation, it provided two undergraduate students with in-depth research experience and training in conducting developmental research.

        "abstractText": "High-quality water is needed for sustaining all life on Earth. Different types of pollution, however, can reduce water quality and harm the plants, animals, and people that depend on water to live. Specifically, recent wildfires across the U.S. may reduce water quality in several ways. For example, ash from wildfires can end up in lakes and rivers, potentially harming aquatic organisms and drinking water supplies. In this project, a group of researchers will study water quality of northern Minnesota lakes after the 2021 Greenwood Fire. This wildfire burned a large part of Superior National Forest in fall 2021, including areas near 28 lakes. The researchers expect that after spring snowmelt or rain, ash and large pieces of burned plants will wash into these lakes and reduce water quality. They will visit lakes five times from spring to late summer of 2022 to document any water quality changes following the Greenwood Fire. Results of this study will help water managers in Minnesota and elsewhere predict how water quality in lakes and reservoirs may change after future wildfires. This project will also help people who live near lakes understand how the water activities they care about, such as fishing and boating, may be affected by future wildfires.<br/><br/>Although wildfire activity is increasing across the U.S. and concern is mounting over fire effects on water resources, few studies have documented fire effects on lake ecosystems. At 10844 ha in size, the 2021 Greenwood Fire in Superior National Forest was the largest lightning-caused Minnesota wildfire in 10 years and covered all or parts of 28 lake watersheds through October 2021. This project assembled an integrative group of aquatic ecosystem, landscape, and fire ecologists to study the physical, chemical, and biological responses of northern Minnesota lakes to the Greenwood Fire. The researchers hypothesized that (1) lake responses will vary proportionally to the percent watershed burned and between drainage vs. isolated lakes and (2) post-fire temporal trajectories will vary according to major hydrologic events (e.g., snowmelt, precipitation). Both hypotheses are being tested using Bayesian approaches (i.e., information theoretic modeling and model choice procedures). Approximately 15 lakes are being sampled each in (1) burned and (2) unburned control watersheds beginning after spring snowmelt, a critical time for the delivery of nutrients and materials from the burned landscape to lakes, and throughout summer 2022.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "      Wildfires represent both an important historical process for maintaining prairies and forests and a potentially major disturbance to lakes and streams. While wildfires are most commonly associated with the Western US, the Midwestern US has a long history of wildfires, including in lake-dense, northern forested regions of the Upper Great Lakes. Wildfire frequency and severity are increasing as a consequence of changing climate. Therefore, wildfires may represent an increasingly important disturbance to northern forested lakes in the future. This project sought to better understand how lakes in this area respond to wildfires by studying a population of 30 lakes (15 in burned watersheds, 15 in unburned watersheds) located in or nearby the 2021 Greenwood Fire burn area (10844 hectares), a lightning-caused wildfire near Isabella, MN. Study lakes were selected to represent a range of wildfire burn size and severity (for example, 1% to 91% of watershed burned). Lakes were sampled monthly from May-September 2022, the year following the wildfire, for a comprehensive suite of water quality variables.   Intellectual merit of our study was building important new knowledge about how wildfires affect lake health. Previous wildfire-aquatic ecosystem research has largely been conducted on streams and rivers in the western US, but lakes in the Midwestern US may not show similar responses due to differences in geology, hydrology, climate, and vegetation. Our study's combination of location (Midwestern US), large scale (number of lakes), and sampling frequency (monthly from late spring to early fall), as well as our inclusion of lakes in watersheds ranging from minimally burned to nearly fully burned made it unique. To implement our study design, we sampled 30 lakes (15 in burned watersheds, 15 in unburned watersheds), which represents the largest study of lake responses to a single wildfire in North America. Further, we sampled lakes monthly during the ice-free season to investigate how wildfires affected seasonal water quality patterns in lakes; previous studies typically sampled lakes once during the summer.   Our research findings showed that lakes in burned watersheds had consistently greater amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon and were considerably murkier compared to control lakes (unburned watersheds). Interestingly, increases in nutrients did not lead to increases in algae production, potentially due to increased water murkiness and insufficient light. In lakes with burned watersheds, total phosphorus was the only variable that significantly increased with increasing percent of the watershed vegetation undergoing a high severity burn. Increases in total nitrogen and carbon responded most to the percent of the shoreline that burned, but the response was not significant and leveled off. Lake and landscape factors generally explained more variability in the water quality responses than burn severity, but the fire variable with the strongest explanatory power was the percent of the shoreline vegetation that experienced a high severity burn. Monthly differences between burned and unburned lakes persisted for most of the water quality variables except pH, which was similar across all lakes. Taken together, our study demonstrated considerable impacts of wildfire on lake water quality throughout the first year following fire, with more severe burns near lake shorelines leading to the greatest effects.   Broader impacts of our study include improved knowledge to support lake and forest management decisions, especially concerning responses to wildfires, and training opportunities for students and early career scientists who will be responsible for mitigating impacts of wildfires on forest and lake health in the future. Our findings showed what fire, lake, and landscape characteristics cause the biggest lake water quality responses to fire, which can help lake managers target limited funding to lakes most at risk of water quality degradation. By showing that high-severity burns near lake shorelines had the greatest impacts on lakes, our findings will help forest managers improve fire risk mitigation activities, such as the placement of prescribed burns and mechanical thinning, to reduce the impacts of wildfires or prescribed burns on waterbodies. For workforce development, this project directly supported two early-career scientists (PhD degrees) and one nontraditional undergraduate student (Bachelor's degree), helping to retain them in the sciences as they explored permanent career pathways. Additionally, our project team benefited from working with excellent early-career or undergraduate women in STEM (1 PhD degree, 1 Bachelor's degree, 4 undergraduate students), who received critical professional development opportunities because of this project.

This project was designed to test that prediction, by searching for evidence of early human occupation in an area of cloud forest whether the antiquity of human acitivity had never before been tested.   To do so, we conducted archaeological excavation at six caves and rockshelters. Following excavation we analyzed the artifacts recovered, including stone tools, broken pottery, animal bone, and plant remains. We also used radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the sites. The remains of plants and animals were particularly important because they allow us to understand what foods people could (and could not) find on the landscape.   We found that humans have lived in the region for at least 5,500 years, including before the development of agriculture. This new evidence is contradictory to the belief that humans would have had to rely on agricultural technology to extract enough nutrition from cloud forests. In fact, while the people living in this cloud forest did adopt some agricultural products early, they also continued to make use of wild foods, such as white-tailed deer and tropical fruits.

        "abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve the current US deficiency in foreign language skills and bring critical innovations to the $13 billion global online language learning market. Current language learning methods focus on rote memorization and not nearly enough on using the language. Experiential learning opportunities in which students have free-flowing conversations driven by interests are often not introduced until the third or fourth semester of language study. The result is that American students graduate with little ability or motivation to actually use a foreign language and maintain any degree of language fluency. Using novel machine learning technologies and game design, this project will let students learn a language while texting with their friends and help teachers facilitate conversation-based learning in their classrooms. The project will offer opportunities for students in classes located in the US to interact with students in other countries around the globe, turning textbook abstractions into real people, culture, and language. Ultimately, these machine learning solutions enable a platform that the 1.2 billion individuals learning language worldwide can use to supplement textbook instruction with experiential learning for greater long-term fluency.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a state-of-the-art machine learning solution to address critical challenges in the implementation of<br/>conversation-based language learning. Learning languages through conversation has been shown by previous research to be engaging and effective. However, beginners are often<br/>uncomfortable in the early days because they aren\u2019t confident in expressing themselves. Educators can provide the needed support, but it is difficult for them to give every student<br/>personalized tutelage. This project will jumpstart these initial conversations with the help of in-chat translation, dictionaries, and grammar checking. To cement learning, the project will generate practice activities directly from chats and deliver the activities in the context of those authentic text conversations. This project will analyze the text chats and form hypotheses about student strengths and weaknesses. The system will then test these hypotheses with assessments automatically generated from the same text chats. The Phase I technical objectives are to 1) automatically identify examples of learning objectives in student text 2) align system-generated and human-authored assessment activities and 3) predict student scores on practice activities with increasing accuracy. Over time, the system will understand student needs to maximize learning and engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "     Overview:   The US lags behind the rest of the world in foreign languages and it affects our ability to act globally. Communicative language teaching, or learning within the context of conversation, offers an engaging, authentic and research-backed method of language learning. However, beginners have a hard time with conversation for lack of skill and confidence. Educators can provide needed support with individual attention but are impeded by class sizes and limited time with students.   Pangea Chats web and mobile platform lets students learn a language while texting friends and helps teachers implement communicative pedagogies within beginner-level language courses.   Funding by the National Science Foundation helped Pangea Chat to:     Develop and launch a prototype for web, Android, and iOS platforms.     Engage in testing and iteration with tens of teachers and hundreds of students.     Secure additional funding from state, local, and private sources.     Conduct a pilot efficacy study demonstrating promising results.     Achieve finalist status in a major language learning technology competition.     Present Pangea Cat at several industry conferences.     Establish channel partnerships with other organizations.     Initiate the first paid pilots within US universities.     Intellectual Merit:   Pangea Chat is an intelligent language learning environment which facilitates learning by doing within the context of peer-to-peer instant messaging conversation. Pangea Chat integrates human and artificial intelligence (AI) to immediately augment student communicative abilities while fostering learning and supporting educator practices.   Imagine you're learning a new language and can instantly chat with peers in that language, thanks to a blend of human and AI support. That's Pangea Chat. As you send messages, the AI assists you, enhancing your language skills in real-time. It's more than just a chat app; it's an immersive learning experience where games meet language practice. Students engage in meaningful conversations, receiving adaptive feedback and instruction. And for those concerned about security, Pangea Chat is built on a decentralized, open-source protocol, offering institutions the flexibility to self-host and ensuring data security.   Broader Impacts:   Pangea Chat can contribute to US national defense, economic competitiveness, and quality of life by 1) making language learning more accessible and inclusive, 2) helping build human connections at home and abroad, 3) better aligning AI-powered edTech to educational institutions, and 4) serving as a model for the potential of decentralized social media.   Phase I work has derisked the technical feasibility of facilitating peer-to-peer conversations between beginner-level learners and started validating business assumptions related to customer needs, pricing/costs, and marketing/sales channels. Phase II work will improve upon and develop evidence for 1) the privacy, security, and alignment of the intelligent language learning environment, 2) student engagement, 3) educational efficacy, and 4) the feasibility of scaling to additional languages.   Achievement of Phase II success criteria will position Pangea Chat to address the needs of US university beginner-level Spanish educators with clear and objective evidence of core value propositions. Pangea Chat will be verified private, secure and aligned for the university market. The product will engage students in 20x more conversation practice per semester than direct competitors. Efficacy studies will demonstrate gains across key metrics for developing language proficiency. As sales and marketing capacity grow, Pangea Chat will expand to Latin American universities teaching English. As we add Portuguese and other languages, Pangea Chat will expand to address all US university students studying foreign languages.

        "projectOutComesReport": " The goal of the proposed IUCRC Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence (CAAI) is to develop industry/academic parternships to accelerate applied research in AI that can catalze industry. CAAI is a consortium of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Stony Brook University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, with a planned international site at Tampere University, Finland, and a site at Tulane University. CAAI will engage industrial partners through the Business Model Generation approach. University and industrial partners will collaborate to conduct pre-competitive research on applied AI focusing on applications for the built environmentin healthcare/biomedicine, manufacturing/logistics, and energy/environment, by teams comprising of faculty investigators, industrial monitors, graduate research assistants, and undergraduate participants.  The outcomes for this Planning Grant period are as follows:  - Initial outreach and education: The Planning Grant team met regularly to brainstorm potential IAB members based on our existing contacts. We then solicited support from the University Corporate Development Office, as well as GNO, Inc., the premier regional development office. We additionally met virtually with the Lead Site ULL and their industry liason officer. PI Culotta participated in the IUCRC bootcamp to learn about how to engage IAB members and articulate value propositions.    - Introductory Luncheon: In March 2022, we hosted an introductory luncheon, in partnership with GNO, Inc., to introduce the proposed Center to interested organizations and to conduct surveys to inform the articulation of the Center's value proposition. Through one-on-one interviews and the structured surveys with over 20 organizations, we learned that (1) recruiting a well-trained workforce was a high priority for the majority of members; (2) vision and language technologies were the most sought after AI areas; (3) cross-cutting issues of fairness, bias, robustness, and ethics when using AI for decision making were a primary concern. We also learned that issues of data governance, intellectual property, and project management were potential roadblocks to forming industry-academic partnerships. Informed by these interviews and discussions, we refined our Research Roadmap to focus on the theme \"Making AI Work in Practice,\" focusing on decision making, robustness, and fairness.    - Interviews and project scoping: From March 2022-October 2022, we interacted with a total of 49 potential partners, of which 21 proceeded to in-depth, one-on-one interviews to identify projects of value to the partners. We expanded our team to include SP Montemore to account for the interest received in AI applied to life sciences and health. The Planning Grant team met internally and with the ULL leadership to scope and revise projects based on industry interest.  - Planning Meeting: We held the Planning Meeting at Tulane in October 2022. For the Planning Meeting, we had eleven attendees from eight organizations. We pitched seven projects informed by our prior interviews, focusing on robust machine learning, sequential decision making, reinforcement learning for clinical trials, medical data analysis, transfer learning for life sciences, interpretable AI, and causal learning with text data. We conducted surveys to collect feedback after each presentation, as well as a final survey to rank order all projects.        Last Modified: 05/02/2023       Submitted by: Aron Culotta",

        "abstractText": "This dissertation project focuses on the detailed documentation and study of an under-studied language with rapidly decreasing intergenerational transmission. The language displays a number of structural characteristics which are relatively unique within its language family;  deeper investigation into the origin of morphological agreement and verb classes has the potential to shed light on broader issues within theoretical linguistics such as the underlying representation of lexical items, while also furthering our understanding of the ways in which languages change and develop over time. In addition, this project aims to provide a solid empirical foundation for future research into variation across related languages, contributing to our knowledge of typological patterns found in and around the region. Finally, it is a goal of the project that the resulting data, processed in close collaboration with native speaker consultants and publicly archived, will be multifunctional and suitable for adaptation into community-facing literary, pedagogical, and reference material, facilitating local efforts at language maintenance and preservation.<br/><br/>The researcher will conduct on-site fieldwork with native speakers in order to thoroughly document and analyze grammatical structure with particular focus on the language's morphological systems and their interface with other syntactic and phonological phenomena from both a synchronic and diachronic perspective. In particular, this project is built around the hypothesis that there is a developing incipient inflection class system, wherein the choice of prefix shape with a particular set of verbs is no longer phonologically or semantically predictable. By closely investigating sub-systemic alternations in verb class, valency, voice, and serialization, this project aims to shed light on issues such as i) the structural status and historical origin of subject agreement and semi-idiosyncratic verb classes; ii) the distribution of pronominal elements and their intersection with the development of case and alignment; and iii) the grammaticalization of valency- and category-changing derivational morphology and their relationship to the abstract representation of lexical items. Thus, this work has the potential to contribute to our broader understanding of morphosyntactic theory cross-linguistically, while also bringing a novel diachronic perspective to the study of an understudied language family.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  This project investigated a range of morphosyntactic phenomena in the understudied Timoric language Amarasi from both a synchronic and diachronic perspective, focusing on the inflectional and derivational subsystems of the language with a particular emphasis on subject agreement, voice, and valency-changing morphology. This project involved the careful documentation, description, and analysis of Amarasi, the results of which formed the basis for the co-PI Tans doctoral dissertation (including a short sketch grammar of the language), multiple conference presentations and invited talks, a journal article and conference proceedings, and several manuscripts currently in preparation and/or under review for publication. From the perspective of broader impacts, the raw data collected from this project has also been deposited into a publicly available collection on PARADISEC and is currently undergoing continued processing to facilitate use by a variety of users (academics, language teachers, community members, and others).   The major question under investigation was that of whether Amarasi has developed an incipient verb class system as expressed via the semi-idiosyncratic distribution of two paradigms of agreement prefixes. Through the collection of novel data and comparative analysis of several Timoric languages, this project found that the apparent class system is epiphenomenal, arising from the interaction between syntactico-structural representations of argument structure/voice and regular phonotactic restrictions once one recognizes the diachronic loss of once-transparent causative morphology. Contrary to initial hypotheses, this project demonstrated that previous approaches to inflection class systems as expressed with diacritic features are actually insufficient to capture the relevant distributions based on their interaction with cross-categorial derivation. This the stage for a broader cross-linguistic exploration of the notion and representation of class.   This project also described and presented novel proposals regarding the theoretical status and diachronic origin of i) valency-decreasing non-active voice morphology, ii) valency-increasing applicative and causative morphology, and iii) non-subject case marking in the form of a previously unidentified dative case in the language. In so doing, Amarasi was shown to expand on existing typologies and broaden our understanding of the interface between form, function, and language change in general.   The collected data and accompanying analysis has contributed to our empirical and theoretical knowledge of not only Amarasi and the Meto language continuum, but also of cross-dialectal variation and the development of Timoric languages as whole, providing a basis for future research into the Austronesian languages of East Nusa Tenggara.

        "abstractText": "According to the Census Bureau, more than 41 million people in the US speak Spanish at home. It is important to understand how the growing number of US children who are raised speaking Spanish at home come to acquire and use language as adults. The goal of this project is to explore the use of a variable grammatical form in bilingual adults who were raised in the US speaking Spanish at home and English in school; these bilingual adults are also known as \u201cheritage speakers\u201d. Examining variable patterns leads to a more comprehensive understanding of bilingual language acquisition in the US context. Disseminating the findings from this project through both scientific and public channels helps researchers and educators to develop more effective educational strategies and improves speech-language pathologists' ability to assess language abilities in clinical settings. <br/><br/>Previous studies have shown that heritage speakers demonstrate significant variability in their use of grammatical forms. This variability can be traced to language-specific factors as well as aspects of an individual\u2019s language experience. While variable grammatical patterns appear across languages and speech communities, these patterns are rarely studied in heritage speakers. This project uses a sentence repetition task with heritage language speakers and monolinguals to examine the trade-off between competing influences on the distribution of differential object marking (DOM), a phenomenon found in a number of languages where certain objects in a sentence are accompanied by a prefix/suffix, preposition, or other marker. The project addresses the following questions: (1) How do heritage speakers acquire variable grammatical patterns such as DOM? (2) What are the linguistic and extralinguistic factors that constrain heritage speakers\u2019 use of variable patterns? (3) How does variable usage change across generations of bilingual speakers? This novel approach combining the study of variation, language acquisition, and cross-generational heritage speakers has significant potential to contribute to our understanding of bilingualism and language acquisition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Nearly a quarter of individuals in the United States speak languages other than English at home. Many of the children who are raised speaking English in addition to their other home language become bilingual adults who are often known as heritage speakers of their home languages. This project sought out to discover patterns of language use among such heritage bilingual speakers of Spanish to gain a better understanding of how bilingual speakers acquire and maintain linguistic patterns of their non-English home languages into adulthood. To achieve this goal, we focused on a grammatical property of Spanish known as differential object marking (DOM), which is a well-studied grammatical structure in Spanish that heritage speakers of Spanish use with high degrees of variability, both within and across individuals. DOM occurs primarily with nouns referring to humans, while it is rarely used with inanimate objects. We compared 34 adult heritage speakers raised in the U.S. to 14 adult Spanish-dominant bilinguals raised in Spanish-speaking countries. Both groups were residing in the U.S. at the time of data collection. We examined how the two groups used DOM when repeating pre-recorded sentences in Spanish and how they processed DOM while they listened to sentences in Spanish.      While listening to sentences in Spanish, the two groups did not differ in their immediate processing of nouns whether the sentence contained DOM or not. However, during later parts of the sentences, group differences did appear. The 14 Spanish-dominant bilinguals tended to slow down on sentences with unexpected uses of DOM, while the 34 heritage speakers tended to slow down on sentences containing expected DOM patterns. Slowing down in processing tends to occur when processing information that is new or unexpected, so the heritage speakers opposite pattern is potentially related to their uncertainty in when DOM should be used. Further analysis revealed that the heritage speakers may be especially prone to uncertainty when DOM is contracted with another word in the sentence and, as a result, is more difficult to perceive.      Finally, we examined how 23 heritage speakers and 8 Spanish-dominant bilinguals produced DOM when they repeated spoken sentences. The heritage speakers tended to use less DOM overall compared to the Spanish-dominant bilinguals when repeating sentences that originally included DOM with human or animal nouns. However, when sentences had inanimate objects without DOM, the heritage speakers produced more DOM on average than the Spanish-dominant speakers. These unexpected patterns of DOM in the speech of the heritage speaker group mirror their patterns of DOM processing.      The similar patterns in both the processing data and the speech data suggest that the processing of grammatical structures in heritage speakers may lead to differences in how these structures are used in their speech. Thus, the processing of language represents an important consideration in these bilingual heritage speakers continue to use their home language in adulthood.      This project has provided training for one doctoral student and two undergraduate students in linguistic and psycholinguistic research on Spanish-English bilingualism in the United States. So far, this project has resulted in the publication of one doctoral dissertation, and the findings have been presented in preliminary forms at both local and national academic venues, most notably at the Human Sentence Processing conference in 2023.

        "abstractText": "This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) grant will fund research that enables increased flexibility in the control of sound propagating through civil infrastructure, mechanical machinery, and aerospace systems, including for applications in acoustic imaging, defect detection, and noise control, thereby promoting the progress of science and advancing the national prosperity and welfare. Acoustic metasurfaces are two-dimensional thin artificial materials that are empowered with extraordinary control over the scattering of sound waves. Until recently, such metasurfaces had fixed configurations that were difficult to tune in real time, thereby limiting their potential use and performance. A recent focus on tunable, reconfigurable, and programmable acoustic metasurfaces promises efficient and smart control of sound waves, but existing solutions suffer from sophisticated tuning mechanisms, use of active elements, and poor efficiency. This project will overcome these limitations by demonstrating new and simple mechanisms for reconfigurable acoustic wave control using flexible structures designed by origami principles, whose folded geometry may be modulated in real time. Although origami principles have been widely used in robotics, soft materials, and flexible electronics, the relationship between dynamic origami and acoustic wave control has been largely unexplored. The knowledge and tools generated by this research will enable the next generation of reconfigurable wave-based devices that are adaptive to changing environments and performance objectives. Activities aiming to engage new generations of students in STEM education and research include outreach programs to K-12 students and extensive planned participation of undergraduate students in team-based technical research projects.<br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental contributions to a practical understanding of how the shape, periodicity, and size of origami structures change dynamically as they undergo deformation and the concomitant impact on acoustic wave propagation. It will achieve this outcome by building a theoretical and computational framework for characterizing and predicting acoustic wave interactions with dynamic origami structures, by developing design strategies that enable application-specific synthesis of dynamic origami structures with target functionalities, and by investigating different tuning mechanisms. Experimental validation and testing will be performed on prototype reconfigurable acoustic metasurfaces that leverage principles of origami highlighted by the theoretical analysis. Such experimental realization will be used to demonstrate wave steering and wave focusing functionalities typical of sensing, communication, imaging, and energy harvesting applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  The research aims to design and develop structures that can control the propagation of sound in a tunable and reconfigurable manner. Tunable acoustic wave manipulation adds more functionality and versatility to existing applications by allowing reconfigurability in the structures. However, current technologies exhibit challenges in many aspects, including limited control capabilities, sophisticated tuning mechanisms, and high power consumption. To address these limitations, this research investigated approaches by leveraging the concept of origami. Structures designed by origami principles exhibit flexible geometries that can be configured by mechanical actuations. This property is exploited to yield tunable wave control as the waves interact with these structures.   The outcomes from this research have been disseminated to the scientific community through journal articles and conference presentations. The results have advanced the utility of acoustic wave in different applications that involve noise and vibration control, and biomedical ultrasound. These include: 1) An asymmetrical patterned structure with piezoelectric components for the vibration control in thin beams. The piezoelectric components allow for the tuning of the transmission and reflection properties of incoming waves. 2) A resonator based acoustic filter that can be used in smart speakers to mitigate cyberattacks of these devices. By filtering out the potentially malicious ultrasound components, security can be enhanced. 3) An acoustic lens for the generation of versatile acoustic beams in an underwater environment. These developments hold the potential to promote a wide range of real-world applications that use sound as a primary platform.   Three graduate students, including one PhD student and two M.Sc. students have been supported by the project. They have been working on constructing theoretical and numerical models that study the interaction between acoustic waves and structures as well as the experimental testing of the prototypes developed for various applications. The project also involved undergraduate students in research activities through the Engineering Clinic model at Rowan University, which provided abundant hands-on opportunities for them to learn technical skills related to acoustic engineering. The results from this project were also integrated into the PIs course Introduction to Finite Element Analysis via the development of group projects to enhance the learning experience and outcome.

The investigators will research methods for preserving the privacy of that data, with the goal of enabling a future manufacturing service infrastructure to aggregate, manage and reuse data from multiple manufacturers.

        "projectOutComesReport": "  This project established a robust foundation for a manufacturing data-sharing ecosystem tailored to enhancing AI-driven methodologies across the manufacturing sector. Focused on the development and validation of the proposed data-sharing framework, this project facilitates private, efficient data exchanges between multiple manufacturing entities while securing intellectual property and sensitive information.      The advancement of manufacturing AI models heavily relies on the availability of large, informative, and high-quality datasets. However, it takes a long time and intensive effort for a single manufacturing entity to collect sufficient data from rich modalities in the manufacturing process to support the incubation of advanced AI models, such as deep neural networks. Data-sharing also poses significant challenges when sharing data with private information among manufacturers. The conducted research primarily focused on addressing the dual challenges of maintaining data privacy while maximizing the utility of shared data across multiple manufacturing entities. The project successfully developed a scalable, hierarchical data-sharing framework capable of integrating diverse data sources across various manufacturing contexts, thereby enhancing AI model training and application. In the near term, the proposed data-sharing framework allows a third party to provide data-sharing services to all manufacturers in the same industry to accelerate the deployment of AI methods to address their technical challenges. In the long term, data-sharing can provide equal opportunities for all members of the manufacturing industry to participate in the rapid development of AI research.       Notable intellectual components of the framework include: (1) The design of the foundational technology for privacy-preserving data distillation and attention-based data selection, allowing for the dynamic incorporation of diverse datasets into AI models without compromising sensitive information. (2) The extension to hierarchical and task-driven data integration to recognize and categorize data from different sources. This capability significantly improves the efficiency of data utilization and allows the data-sharing framework to integrate new data seamlessly and continuously adapt to evolving manufacturing needs without complete system retraining. (3) The incorporation of two novel boosting algorithms to address initial data scarcity in new tasks, reduce redundancy, and improve performance even when starting with limited data. (4) The design of a graph neural network (GNN) model that integrates metadata to further optimize data sharing among manufacturing stakeholders and exploit the synergistic effects of sharing multiple datasets simultaneously across a network of data owners. (5) The design of a voxel diffusion model for generating 3D designs optimized for manufacturability. This model allows manufacturers to simulate and produce high-performance designs that meet specific manufacturing criteria.      The team's findings were disseminated at several international conferences, including the IEEE International Conference on Big Data, the ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), and the INFORMS Annual Meeting, enhancing the visibility and impact of our research. The project also supported 8 graduate students (3 of them are women-in-STEM PhDs). Students contributing to this project gained valuable experience in cutting-edge technologies, co-authored peer-reviewed papers, produced doctoral and master thesis dissertations, and presented their work at international conferences.      The proposed methodologies have been integrated into educational modules, enriching the curriculum in graduate courses in Advanced Machine Learning and providing students with hands-on experience in applying AI to real-world industrial problems. In addition, through seminars, the project introduced AI and manufacturing concepts to approximately 30 high school students, with the aim of inspiring the next generation to pursue STEM careers. These seminars covered various concepts of Machine Learning and AI, Manufacturing AI, Data-Sharing, Privacy-Preserving, and Manufacturing Industrial Internet. Students were invited to hands-on experiences to interact with a Manufacturing Industrial Internet interface design and sensor measurement and accuracy in Additive Manufacturing, which was carried out during the seminar so that students could deploy the sensors and obtain data for AI tasks.      To further test and refine our methodologies, we hosted a Manufacturing AI competition, challenging participants to predict manufacturing outcomes using shared datasets. Finally, a prototype search engine was developed to facilitate the discovery and retrieval of manufacturing data. The search engine utilizes the proposedprivacy-preserving data structures to enable manufacturers to efficiently identify and utilize data from similar entities, promoting collaboration and fostering innovation. During the search query process, manufacturers can upload their data and select attributes or process variables that need to remain confidential. This allows the search engine to understand the context and requirements of the search. Manufacturers can customize data handling based on current project demands and use visualizations to understand the potential utility of the data. The search engine processes the queries and outputs a ranked list of potentially beneficial datasets from other manufacturers. Alongside individual datasets, the search engine also recommends a bundle of datasets that are optimal for acquisition and provides estimates on the provides estimates of how these datasets could improve performance on the downstream task, helping manufacturers make informed decisions based on potential return of investment.

        "abstractText": "Risk perception and risk averting behaviors of vulnerable communities in the emergence and spread of COVID-19 are spatio-temporal functions of individual or group interactions with their online social neighbors within or outside their communities and such interactions need to be captured through diverse information channels (e.g. traditional outlets such as radio, television, internet and/or non-traditional outlets such as social media). The primary goal of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to collect time-sensitive online social media and crowd-sourced data and analyze patterns of health-risk communication and community response in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus using data-driven methods and network science theories. The major focus will be towards understanding how individuals are socially influenced online, while communicating risk and interacting in their respective communities as the disease continues to spread. The notion of influence will be captured by quantifying the network effects on such communication behavior and characterizing how information is exchanged among people who are socially connected online and exposed to health risk in such outbreaks of disease. Given that communities responded to COVID-19 with limited or no preparation and there is uncertainty in the length of recovery for the communities already affected while new communities being threatened, the data collection effort requires rapid response for better coverage and careful monitoring. The data will include large-scale ephemeral online interactions of people in the affected communities and public officials who are involved in COVID-19 response, recovery, and mitigation efforts, followed by a data-driven network analytics and infographics of COVID-19 risk communication strategies and risk averting behaviors adopted. The proposed research will not only expand the knowledge base of spatio-temporal dynamics of risk perception and dissemination strategies in the emergence and aftermath of a major disease outbreak, but will also result in data-driven inference techniques to improve our understanding of how people express diverse concerns and how to harness and embed such information for designing intervention measures. The methodologies and findings of this rapid response research will benefit emergency management and public health agencies to define targeted information dissemination policies for public with diverse needs based on how people reacted to COVID-19 and their social network characteristics, activities, and interactions in response to similar public health hazards.<br/><br/>Public engagement in risk communication can lead to more effective decision-making and enhanced public feedback to the regulatory process. The primary goal of this RAPID project is to mine and analyze large-scale time-sensitive perishable crowd-sourced and social media data (rich spatio-temporal data) and reveal patterns of health-risk communication and community response in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus using data-driven methods and network science theories. The specific aims are threefold: (1) to document how public interact and communicate health risk information through their online social networks during a major disease outbreak; (2) to authenticate data from multiple sources and detect anomalies to avoid information overload and spread of misinformation; and (3) to examine how online social networks influence protective actions (e.g., social distancing, self-quarantine decisions) i.e. information cascades in health risk communication. To achieve the goal and aims, the project will utilize ephemeral time and geo-tagged social media interactions of users, agencies, news sources supplemented with crowd-sourced information on COVID-19. This study will have five theoretical and methodological contributions to the literature. It will: (1) advance our understanding of how individuals are socially influenced online, while communicating health risks and interacting in their respective communities as the disease continues to spread; (2) inform the literature on how information is exchanged among people who are socially connected online and exposed to health risk in such outbreaks of disease; (3) use novel machine-learning and network science models to quantify influence and network effects on such communication behavior; (4) capture the variability in network composition, risk communication strategies and risk averting behaviors adopted based on spatio-temporal correlations of risk and disease contagion; (5) ensure authenticity of the collected data from multiple sources and develop more accurate fully-distributed computational algorithms tailored to health risk anomaly detection in socio-technical systems. The findings from this research will be useful to public health and emergency management agencies for tailoring effective information dissemination policies for diverse user groups based on their social network characteristics, activities, and interactions in response to similar public health hazards. The methodologies, and implications of this research can be transferred in designing effective intervention policies to other natural and man-made disaster contexts in which public health risks become major concerns. The project will engage, mentor, and offer an innovative active learning environment for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students by giving priority to disadvantaged and underrepresented communities in USA. The project will train students on computational skills required for collecting, storing, processing, analyzing and modeling large-scale data using high performance computational resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The major focus was towards understanding how individuals are socially influenced online, while communicating risk and interacting in their respective communities as the disease continues to spread. The research outcomes were developed based on interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers from civil engineering, computer science, and social science. The project has significant societal impacts and will make future response to major pandemics more efficient. As shown in Figure 1 (see attachment), this project involves collecting and analyzing ephemeral social media and crowdsourced data, developing new integrative scientific approaches to modeling online crisis communication behavior, and social network effects across community residents, agencies, and other stakeholders. The key outcomes from this project were: Intellectual Merit 1. Using Application Programing Interface (API), Twitter data was gathered during the 2020 pandemic season which was also one of the most active hurricane season. Twitter data collection were threefold (i) by keywords (covid-19, corona etc.), (ii) by location (i.e. predefined geographic boundary) and (iii) by agency twitter handles (i.e. fema, cdc etc.). Using data scraping techniques, data from publicly available online discussion forums were also such as Uber Drivers Forum that included information related to ridesharing risk in a pandemic. COVID-19 data on confirmed cases and deaths were also collected from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Center for Disease Control, and World Health Organization. 2. Extensive data processing, aggregation, visualization, and exploration activities were performed over the collected data using advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques as well as network science theories. These generated novel insights into the ongoing public concern and communication patterns of the unprecedented risks associated with a major pandemic. The findings of the research provided future policy implications towards developing more efficient communication guidelines for such online platforms where both community residents as well as emergency management and other agencies virtually connect and interact. 3. A user-friendly social media infographics tool (Figure 2) was developed that can capture user reactions and information deviation in online social networks, and its policy implications.  Broader Impacts  1. One PhD dissertation, one MS thesis, four journal articles and two conference papers were published based on the collected data and the developed models. 2. Two PhD level students were supported under this project. Two MS students (one female) and one African-American undergraduate student also worked under this project with supports provided from other funds. The students were trained in the project across civil engineering, social science, and computational sciences. 3. Initial findings of the project were presented at the Annual Natural Hazards Workshop Researchers Meeting (July 2020) and NSF funded PREPARE Kick-off workshop (December 2020). Recent research findings were presented at the Annual Natural Hazards Workshop Researchers Meeting (July 2021), Transportation Research Board Annual Meetings (January 2021, 2022) and Construction Research Congress of the American Society of Civil Engineers (March 2022). These are among top conferences in transportation, construction, and disaster management bringing together a large number of audiences (including researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, practitioners among others) with diverse subject matter expertise. 4. A new graduate course Hazard Mitigation was developed and offered by Dr. Sadri in Spring 2020. This course introduced students to different natural and man-made hazards. Students were later introduced with Covid19 related social media data collection techniques using Application Programming Interfaces (API). Twelve students from three different departments enrolled in the course. 5. An instructional material was developed to facilitate students? understanding of network science theories and network metrics to newly joined graduate students and undergraduate researchers interested in interdisciplinary research. This material included examples of network configuration, data sets, and a script that uses Python-based NetworkX package.       Last Modified: 12/02/2022       Submitted by: Arif Mohaimin Sadri",

The project seeks to enable computer learn without rehearsal, allowing corrections for details that are present in the real world environment. The aim of this project is a solution to be used by computer vision customers to solve their problems immediately (without sending data back to retrain the whole network), reducing machine and customer downtime and disruption while increasing  productivity. The initial focus is on robotics with computer vision limitations though the technology may be useful to other industries. Success in improving computer vision-based learning could facilitate disaster responses, augment current physical abilities, and enable exploration beyond the boundaries of Earth. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will help create a framework to overcome rehearsal requirements that limit automated robots\u2019 utility within life-like, dynamic environments. Artificial intelligence (AI) remains inflexible compared to humans at quickly accumulating knowledge without forgetting what they have previously learned. Robots using AI are currently only used in environments that are very limited and are very tightly controlled. Everything that might happen in the robot\u2019s work environment must be included their training set. The proposed AI solution is suited for learning in dynamic environments without rehearsal while maintaining scalability as information is encountered. This technology may allow robots to be trained within their environment.

        "projectOutComesReport": "   Many AI algorithms today demonstrate impressive recognition: sometimes performing better than humans using a standard training and testing paradigm. However they require a lot of data and applying these methods to robots and edge devices in life-like environments has been difficult. The AI simply does not learn efficiently like humans. There have been efforts to speed up learning by re-using previously learned information. For example in transfer learning the weights of bottom layers of deep networks are fixed and the top layer is learned. Thus learning can be achieved faster. However even with transfer learning, learning is slow, inflexible, and difficult to update like the brain. This is summarized by a well known problem in early neural networks called catastrophic forgetting  the ability to learn completely without changing or losing previous information. This difficulty is a major reason why we cannot have robots in real world environments.   To demonstrate an ability to overcome the amount of data and the catastrophic forgetting problem, we modified a well-known Google demonstration showing fast learning of animal images and increased it further demonstrating increased speed (100x) less data required (   We bundled these properties into our product offering \"Transfer Learning Squared\". We also created a benchmarking demonstration and provided source code for potential customers to access this API and demonstrate on their own data. These advancements will help end users address their learning needs quicker and more efficiently. The increased flexibility of this approach will help reduce costs, increase safety, and enable greater automation in more variable environments bringing more AI to more customers. The API makes this method available to customers while protecting the underlying IP.         Last Modified: 04/16/2024       Submitted by: TsviAchler",

        "abstractText": "Relational algebra (RA) forms a basis of primitive operations such as join, projection, aggregation, and selection that transform one or more input relations (i.e., database tables) into an output relation. It can be used to implement algorithms in graph analytics, deductive databases, program analysis, satisfiability, constraint solving, and machine learning. High-performance RA has the potential to extract vast untapped parallelism from critical applications. Despite this great expressive power, investigation of RA within the HPC community has been limited and significant advances are needed to scale RA on next-generation HPC systems. This work will advance the state of art by developing novel algorithms for massively parallel relational algebra on exascale HPC systems such as the Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). In the context of heterogeneous systems (i.e., those using multiple distinct compute paradigms in concert, like Aurora), this work will address key scaling concerns including workload decomposition, load balancing, communication, and I/O. This work will establish foundations for long-term collaboration with ANL towards the development of foundational theory, practical implementations, and rigorous evaluations of parallel RA. The project will support a graduate student from an underrepresented minority and lay groundwork for a high-impact dissertation.<br/><br/>Owing to increasing inter-network data-movement costs and power constraints, exascale systems are increasingly shifting toward heterogeneous computing environments, with CPUs being coupled with coprocessors such as GPUs. Aurora Supercomputer at Argonne national lab is an example of a leadership-class heterogeneous system; every Aurora node is equipped with multiple GPU co-processors. This work will lead to the development of parallel algorithms for RA, in the context of Aurora specifically and heterogeneous systems more broadly, over three key phases: (1) development of core RA algorithms for multi-GPU nodes; (2) extending these algorithms to supercomputers with many nodes, like Aurora; (3) extending the whole compute process to include scalable parallel IO. First, phase (1) will require investigating three technical approaches for the RA itself, extending them to multi-GPU nodes: (i) radix-hash, (ii) sort-merge, and (iii) nested-loop. Second, in phase (2) the work will investigate inter-node balancing of RA primitives and techniques to minimize data movement across multi-node systems. Finally, in phase (3) a customized parallel IO system and storage model will be developed that will take into account the deepening memory hierarchy available on modern supercomputers. These innovations across three phases will be evaluated using the ALCF supercomputer Aurora, using three application domains: graph mining, static program analysis, and deductive databases for scientific simulations. With exascale insight, this research is poised to create a new generation of applications based on relational algebra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "    This project had two primary objectives: (1) cultivate collaborations with Argonne National Laboratory, providing the PI and students with opportunities to utilize state-of-the-art high-performance supercomputers, and (2) develop innovative algorithms for efficient implementation of iterative relational algebra (RA) on graphics processing units (GPUs). The project successfully achieved both of these goals.    The collaboration with Argonne National Lab yielded valuable near-term and long-term partnerships. The PI and a group of three students gained hands-on experience working in a cutting-edge laboratory environment. This research led to multiple peer-reviewed publications, showcasing the project's scientific value and impact. Moreover, it fostered new collaborations and relationships that are expected to continue producing fruitful results in the future.    The research conducted under this grant has laid the groundwork for a high-performance implementation of iterative RA on GPUs, which is essential for accelerating analytics in declarative logic programming languages like Datalog. Such languages are particularly useful for relational data analytics across various domains, including graph mining, program analysis, and social media analytics. Key outcomes and findings include: (1) The development of an optimized GPU-based hash table for relational data, enabling efficient hash joins between relations on the GPU. (2) The fusion of RA operations, such as joins and projections, to enhance memory access and computational efficiency, reducing time and memory consumption for iterated joins by up to 5%. (3) Performance evaluations demonstrating speedups of up to 10.8x compared to cuDF (a GPU dataframe library) and 3.9x compared to Souffl (a state-of-the-art CPU-based Datalog engine) for transitive closure computation. These innovations constitute significant steps towards developing a comprehensive GPU-based Datalog engine capable of extracting massive data parallelism for relational analytics applications. The techniques developed can be generalized to other finite-domain Datalog programs beyond the transitive closure use case demonstrated in this project.    The project also resulted in the development of novel algorithms for non-uniform all-to-all data exchanges, a crucial component in implementing parallel multi-node iterative relational algebra. Non-uniform all-to-all plays a vital role in materializing the new tuples generated at each iteration. The research team introduced two innovative algorithms: padded Bruck and two-layer Bruck. These novel approaches significantly enhanced the performance of all-to-all algorithms, surpassing the efficiency of vendor-optimized implementations. This technological advancement paves the way for the implementation of parallel iterative relational algebra on multi-GPU systems. By enabling faster and more efficient data exchanges across multiple nodes, these algorithms contribute to the scalability and performance of relational algebra operations on large-scale datasets.    The broader impacts of this project include advancing the use of modern GPU architectures for high-performance declarative programming and data analytics, enabling more scalable implementations of relational algorithms on larger datasets. By making these powerful programming paradigms more accessible and efficient, this research can accelerate data-driven discoveries and applications across various scientific domains. In conclusion, this work made substantial progress on core components necessary for leveraging GPUs in iterative relational algebra for logic programming languages. The promising results obtained encourage further research on unified GPU-based declarative engines to democratize high-performance relational analytics.

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Intellectual Merit Optical phase variations of frequency-stabilized laser light in fiber-optic telecommunications cables reveal seismic waves from earthquakes hundreds of kilometers away. The so-called Ultrastable Laser Interferometry (ULI) measurements of phase and corresponding cable-strain variations utilize light transmitted through the fiber and thus promise sensing over cables thousands of kilometers long, albeit at present without range-resolution along the fiber. This stands in contrast to distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), which uses backscattered light and offers fine range-resolution, but which is presently limited to distances of 100 km or less. In addition, the very narrow optical bandwidth of ULI promises to allow measurements on operational, rather than dark fibers (in otherwise un-utilized frequency windows), thus expanding the set of usable cables and greatly lowering access costs. We have acquired the first collocated and concurrent ULI and DAS observations using a 4 km length of optical telecommunications fiber on the seafloor of an inland water way in Washington State. We also gathered concurrent seismic data at stations nearby.  Comparison of the two data types with seismic data allowed us to quantify ULI sensitivity to seismic signals and to much better understand the physics of signal formation in ULI. In addition, we discovered a signal related to tidal current in the ULI data, and were able to understand the origin of this signal using DAS data in conjunction with the ULI data.   Broader Impacts This project collected a data set that can help support the rapid grown of fiber-optic geophysical sensing in general, both subsea and on land. It may advance applications of fiber-optic sensing in areas of high priority for society including earthquake and tsunami early warning. Graduate students at UW and UCSD gained an introduction to data acquisition and handling, as well as the physics underlying the prospectively revolutionary methods involved in this study.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Temperature affects all biological processes, yet the current understanding of how thermal environment impacts populations, organisms, and genetic responses is largely dominated by land and freshwater species. While studies in marine systems are growing in number, there are few studies investigating how marine systems adapt to temperatures in what are called holopelagic animals (animals that live their entire life in the water column). Studying organisms with biological traits distinct from classically studied organisms has great potential to broaden our understanding not only of these organisms, but of fundamental and broad evolutionary processes in general. This knowledge gap will be addressed by studying populations of the holopelagic ctenophore, Mnemiopsis leidyi from distinct thermal environments along its native range of the Atlantic coast of the United States. Investigating the mechanisms species employ to respond to contemporary thermal gradients will provide insights into their capacity to survive the rising temperatures associated with climate change. This project will increase participation in the sciences through mentoring and outreach to groups under-represented in science.<br/><br/>This research will use an integrative approach to expand our understanding of how thermal environment drives differentiation in M. leidyi. First, whole-genome sequencing of M. leidyi populations along the Atlantic coast will be performed in order to characterize how thermal environment affects population dynamics in holopelagic animals. Second, experimental thermal assays from populations along this large latitudinal gradient will provide insights into geographic patterns of resilience to thermal stress and shed light on the interaction between temperature, development, and holopelagic dispersal. Finally, outlier analysis on the whole-genome sequencing data will elucidate how genotypic differentiation arises in the face of ongoing gene flow and how species with life history traits that necessitate exposure to a wide range of temperatures adapt. Importantly, the fellow will receive training in bioinformatics, embryo culturing techniques, developing inclusive research programs, and becoming a more effective science communicator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project worked to describe the population dynamics of the invasive ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi along the US Atlantic coast. Dr. Ketchum conducted fieldwork where she collected samples from 13 locations ranging from Woods Hole, Massachusetts to Panacea, Florida. She then extracted DNA, prepped sequencing libraries, and sent 120 samples of Mnemiopsis to be whole-genome sequenced. She then developed a DNA extraction protocol that yielded high molecular weight DNA from challenging ctenophore tissue, to produce sufficient DNA for Pacbio HiFi sequencing with the aim to generate high-quality reference genomes for both lineages.   Dr. Ketchum found that there are two major genetic lineages of M. leidyi along the Atlantic coast: the northern US Atlantic lineage and the southern US Atlantic lineage with the Outer Banks, North Carolina being the major breakpoint between the two lineages. This research has shown that the Outer Banks sampling location is a hybrid zone between the northern and southern lineage and that there is mitonuclear discordance within this zone. Further, we show that the northern lineage has experienced two major bottlenecks in the last 15,000 years while the southern lineage has experienced steady population growth. Finally, we have identified outliers between the two lineages and are currently working to annotate these genes. This research is currently being prepared for publication and will result in two meaningful publications; one describing the population dynamics of Mnemiopsis and genes involved in divergence, and the other comparing the high-quality genome assemblies.   Broader Impact   In addition to the scientific outcomes of this project, Dr. Ketchum used her time as a PRFB fellow to actively mentor students at both the undergraduate level (an REU student) and the graduate level. Dr. Ketchum worked closely with the REU student for a summer and trained her to filter and analyze sequencing data from start to finish. She trained the graduate students to perform the high molecular weight DNA extractions and to prepare and load libraries for nanopore sequencing so that they could then use this technique in their future research. Two of these students will be included as co-authors on the upcoming publications. The fellow also collaborated with over ten different scientists along the US Atlantic coast to organize and collect Mnemiopsis samples. Finally, Dr. Ketchum taught classes on her research and pursuing graduate school and research as a career to high school students at Mercer High School in Washington State.   Dr. Ketchum served as a session chair and presented her research at the SICB conference in January 2024, as well as invited seminars, and has provided insight into how holopelagic species arise without clear barriers to dispersal.

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addressed the need for efficient hardware accelerators capable of handling all data in real numbers instead of simple integers, as required by VR microprocessors and headsets manufacturers. The innovation and development of this patent-pending IP offer several advantages, including improved speed, accuracy, low-power and compliance with the industrial standard IEEE Std 754-2019.  The team at Arith Inc. identified the market demand for this solution and conducted a Freedom to Operate (FTO) survey to ensure there were no conflicting patents or patent applications. They filed two nonprovisional (a.k.a. full utility) patent applications to protect their inventions. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 induced semiconductor shortage, the team acquired a last field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) evaluation kit with a toolchain license and used it to create their fully-pipelined IP with the popular Verilog hardware description language.  Arith's proprietary \"recip32\" IP offers a reciprocal and reciprocal square root result with a fixed low 4-cycle latency, which is six times faster than the current Sweeney, Robertson and Tocher (SRT) and Newton-Raphson designs. Arith's \"mul\" IP delivers a multiplication product with a 3-cycle latency. When coupled, the \"recip32-mul\" IP offers a division or square root result in just 7 cycles, three times faster than current designs, while also providing the ability to signal standardized exceptions such as division by zero. This plug-and-play IP requires no external zero checking, operation scaling, or other software assistance.   Through extensive simulations and validations, Arith's patent-pending innovations demonstrated accurate results even when handling tiny or huge numbers, signed zeros, infinities, etc. Their IP successfully generated the correct outputs in accordance with the IEEE 754 standard. Additionally, the division by zero exception handling mechanism was fully functional and reliable.          Last Modified: 04/20/2023       Submitted by: David H Chen",

        "abstractText": "Visualizing a protein\u2019s 3D structure at atomic resolution is essential to understand its function. Historically, a technique called X-ray crystallography was preferred to obtain atomic-level structures of proteins. However, crystallography is undesirable for studying large and dynamic protein assemblies or proteins that reside in lipid membranes. But because proteins with these traits are key to many biological processes, new techniques to visualize their atomic structures are required to understand their cellular functions. An advanced form of microscopy called cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) is ideal for studying these challenging proteins, and recent advances have made it capable of achieving atomic resolution. This fellowship will support the PI and research team in acquiring hands-on training in cryoEM by experts at the Pacific Northwest Center for CryoEM (PNCC), a state-of-the-art user facility operated by the Oregon Health &amp; Science University and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Upon completion of the fellowship, the researchers will be cryoEM specialists, and apply this new knowledge to visualize structures of the large membrane-embedded protein assemblies they study in atomic-level detail. Further, the fellowship will bolster research and education in the molecular life sciences at the University of Nebraska (NU) by importing cryoEM expertise there. This expertise will be passed to other researchers and students across Nebraska via lab-based and in-class experiences that will impart the theory and practice of this state-of-the-art structural technique to them. As no institution in the state has cryoEM capability, infrastructure, or expertise, this fellowship has potential to be transformative to Nebraskans.<br/><br/>The PI\u2019s group use the specialized training in cryoEM to propel their structural biology capacities in new and transformative directions. CryoEM will enable the PI\u2019s group to resolve 3D structures of the small membrane protein-comprised supramolecular machines they study that will help define the mechanistic principles that drive self-assembly of these proteins. These membrane protein assemblies warrant in-depth comprehension because they control two key biological processes in animals\u2014fortification of epithelial intercellular spaces called tight junctions, and synthesis of fatty acids that produce lipids vital to membrane organization. The fellowship will function by establishing a collaborative training ecosystem between the PI\u2019s group and PNCC, with the primary goal to acquire deep knowledge of the cryoEM workflow, which includes sample preparation; negative stain EM; grid screening and evaluation; image collection; image processing and particle classification; 3D model building and refinement; and structure determination by cryoEM. This cryoEM expertise will foster new independent and collaborative research in Nebraska by creating a core of specialists at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) that will train additional NU researchers, allowing many groups to use cryoEM and national centers like PNCC to determine structures of other important macromolecular systems. Educational objectives to teach future generations the theory and practice of state-of-the-art structural techniques like cryoEM will also be realized by integrating this training into the advising activities and undergraduate biochemistry courses the PI conducts at UNL. Because UNL, NU, and other regional institutions currently lack abilities in cryoEM, this fellowship will provide an essential knowledgebase that will have wide-reaching impacts on the research and educational trajectories of many individuals and groups throughout Nebraska and the Great Plains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": " Researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), Drs. Vecchio and Kapoor, have used this RII Track-4 Fellowship to learn a new scientific technique called cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at the Pacific Northwest Center for Cryo-EM (PNCC) in Portland, Oregon over the course of two years. We intended to learn this technique due to its unique capabilities to resolve the 3D structures of dynamic and challenging integral membrane proteins, to better discern these protein's functions. This endeavor was also undertaken because neither UNL nor any institution in Nebraska possesses cryo-EM infrastructure--although UNL is in the process of installing it--so, resident expertise in cryo-EM was a necessity to keep UNL on the cutting-edge of science. We have taken membrane protein samples isolated in our lab and learned the cryo-EM technique first-hand from experts at PNCC through multiple on-site visits as part of this fellowship. In the process, we have become successful independent practitioners, which was the major goal of this fellowship, as demonstrated by structure determination of several new membrane protein complexes using cryo-EM. As a lab, we will refine this expertise and continue to use this technique to bolster our structural biology platforms, which intend to resolve the principles and structures of small membrane protein-comprised supramolecular assembly. Further, we have used this fellowship to organize training sessions and a symposium in cryo-EM, and teach it to scientists within Nebraska. This has been accomplished through integrating cryo-EM into a course taught to 36+ undergraduate biochemistry majors at UNL, lead two training session in negative stain electron microscopy and sample vitrification, as well as assisting with the organization of a cryo-EM symposium that will bring experts from across the US to UNL to inform its researchers and scholars on the practice and application of this ground-breaking technology. In sum, this RII Track-4 Fellowship has transformed the future research, teaching, and professional development trajectories of Drs. Vecchio and Kapoor, and the broader training enabled by this fellowship will have wide-reaching impacts on the research and educational trajectories of many scientists across UNL and the state of Nebraska.

        "abstractText": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Ultrasound is a powerful tool to image diseases including cancer, orthopedic disorders, and heart function. One limitation of ultrasound is that it suffers from low contrast (contrast is the difference in signal intensity between the region of interest and the background tissue). Therefore, there is a large body of research into a special kind of ultrasound known as photoacoustic imaging. Photoacoustic imaging uses light to generate sound only in the area of interest\u2014this increases the contrast. Unfortunately, photoacoustic ultrasound is not yet approved for widespread use in people. This might be partially due to a lack of devices and methods to validate and standardize the novel imaging equipment needed for photoacoustic imaging. Therefore, this work will create specialized plastic objects with optical and acoustic properties that mimic human tissue with different amounts of tissue oxygenation. These objects can be used to calibrate and standardize photoacoustic imaging equipment. This proposal combines expertise from academia and the Food and Drug Administration to identify materials that have similar optical and acoustic properties as human tissue. We will then add dyes that have absorption spectra similar to hemoglobin. The resulting test objects will improve knowledge of how to best create photoacoustic imaging instrumentation that measures tissue oxygenation and might also streamline regulatory approval of this equipment. In turn, this will increase patient access to this important imaging technique to ultimately advance the health and quality of life of US taxpayers. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Photoacoustic imaging provides deep tissue imaging similar to ultrasound but with enhanced optical contrast and additional functional and molecular imaging capabilities. However, no standardized performance test methods or phantoms exist for photoacoustic imaging system evaluation unlike mature techniques such as computed tomography. The fundamental limitation\u2014and scientific problem to be studied here\u2014is a lack of materials to simultaneously simulate tissue properties over a broad range of optical wavelengths and acoustic frequencies. This leaves investigators, instrument manufacturers, and regulatory agencies without clear strategies to evaluate device safety and effectiveness. Our prior work with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) built stable, biologically relevant imaging phantoms with well-characterized optical absorption/scattering coefficients, acoustic impedance, etc. that broadly simulate tissue over a wide range of optical wavelengths and acoustic frequencies. We will now integrate chromophores to simulate tissue oxygenation (SO2) over a range of oxygen saturation/perfusion values. Objective 1 of this research will develop phantoms that simulate blood oxygen-dependent photoacoustic spectra. Combinations of dyes will be selected to develop tunable formulations that reproduce blood-like multispectral photoacoustic signals at sets of discrete optical wavelengths commonly used for photoacoustic oximetry. Photoacoustic-derived SO2 measurements will be compared against ground truth values as well as against photoacoustic measurements in bovine blood with variable SO2. Ground truth SO2 of bovine blood will be measured by oximetry. Objective 2 will use the phantoms to establish quantitative oximetry test methods. These methods will be performed on three different photoacoustic systems located at UCSD and FDA. Phantoms with different background optical properties and containing blood-mimicking inclusions at different depths and mimicked SO2 levels will be used for parametric study of photoacoustic device oximetry performance. Improvements in the SO2 measurement accuracy of our three photoacoustic systems using various fluence correction algorithms will be quantified to determine device sensitivity to tissue properties and morphology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is rapidly emerging for many clinical applications involving vascular mapping and tissue oximetry. Phantom-based evaluation of oximetry accuracy is invaluable for device characterization and performance assessment, but requires specialized flow circuits and human or animal blood, which carries safety risks and is impractical. Towards establishing simpler and safer phantom test methods for PAI oximetry, we developed blood-mimicking dye solutions based on binary mixtures of NIR746A and IRA980 organic dyes in ethylene glycol that can simulate photoacoustic amplitude spectra of blood at both 750 nm and 850 nm for SO2levels from 40-100%. Dye solutions were characterized in terms of optical extinction spectra and photoacoustic amplitude spectra and found to be more stable (2over 15 days) than deoxygenated blood. Breast-mimicking polyacrylamide hydrogel phantoms containing refillable tubes were filled with either dye solutions or deoxygenated bovine blood and imaged using a custom PAI system. The SO2 results showed that the blood-mimicking dyes produced similar levels of SO2accuracy in phantoms compared to blood samples, although some differences in sensitivity and root-mean-square differences were observed. These blood-mimicking dyes may offer a simpler and safer approach to evaluating oximetry measurement accuracy in PAI devices compared to blood flow phantoms. In turn, these insight may support the establishment of standardized phantom-based test methods.      Last Modified: 04/13/2024       Submitted by: JesseVJokerst",

By using that advanced laser, combined with electronics, and using existing optical fiber networks that are already deployed for communication systems we are able to precisely measure the motion of the Earth and ocean.  Field tests were completed in Puget Sound using one optical fiber on land and another optical fiber on a 4 km path under Puget sound.  We compared three different methods for detecting Earth-ocean changes and motion.  The results reveal key information about the Earth-ocean dynamics on both short and long time scales, that includes measurements of: solid earth tides, ocean tides, sediment transport, Earthquakes, as well as average tempurature changes at the bottom of the Puget Sound.  This approach can be a powerful and valuable method for understanding motions and dynamics of the Earth-ocean system and also monitoring for major distruptions and human hazards (Earthquakes, Tsunamis, etc.  Taking advantage of existing optical fiber networks, this approach could be deployed worldwide for basic science in understanding Earth and oceans and in locations that are most critical for infrastructure and human safety.  In our controlled lab setting we have also developed new techniques that can provide additional capabilities such as improved localization and faster detection bandwidths to deployed optical fiber networks and sensors.

In our Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, we set out to establish the viability of an aerosolized pancoronavirus neutralizing agent that can be delivered directly to the lungs, either as an early-stage, post-infection treatment or as a prophylactic. COVID-19 infection is forecasted to become endemic, like influenza, with multiple waves of infections in the foreseeable future. As SARS-CoV2 continuously evolves to give rise to variants that effectively evade acquired immunity and cause breakthrough infections among the vaccinated as well as reinfections, we increasingly see an unmet ongoing medical need. Our approach will present a cost-effective way to prevent COVID-19 infections particularly for highly vulnerable individuals and frontline personnel, and as a first-response treatment in infected individuals.  The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells depends on the binding of viral Spike trimer to the host Ace2 receptor. Our decoy receptor approach would use a recombinant soluble version of the Ace2 receptor that would bind and coat the viral particle, competing for Spike interaction with endogenous Ace2 and thus prevent virus docking to the cell surface (see Figure). Stabilizing mutations in the Ace2 protein could enable it to act as a decoy receptor and also have sufficient stability in an inhalable formulation, allowing it to be deployed directly to the respiratory tract via a nebulizer. The dependence on Ace2 receptor binding is a potential Achilles heel of coronaviruses, as it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 or similar coronaviruses can mutate around the requirement to interact with this host protein.  Utilizing our company's decoy receptor technology, our principal goal was to prove the efficacy of an aerosolized version of an engineered Ace2 decoy receptor protein (Ace2Mut) in an animal model of COVID-19 pathogenesis. To meet our objective, we defined and achieved three main technical milestones: i) to produce sufficient amounts of protein for animal studies, ii) to establish a protein formulation that is optimal for aerosolization, iii) to perform animal challenge studies to confirm the efficacy of the aerosolized Ace2 decoy protein. Our Ace2Mut decoy receptor protein production process involves an optimized single-step purification method that will be readily adaptable to scale-up if we can advance this therapeutic to the clinic. Ace2Mut is a biochemically robust protein that can be delivered via inhalation. Aerosolized delivery of the Ace2Mut protein to the respiratory tract prior to infection completely protected the animals against COVID-19 associated weight loss and death due to COVID-19 infection, confirming the efficacy of our aerosol-based protein therapy to block SARS-CoV2 infection in animals.  In our Phase I project, we established proof-of-concept that our inhaled Ace2 decoy receptor can inhibit COVID-19 infection in an animal model. We aim to further develop the efficacy of this inhaled therapeutic as a long-lasting prophylactic against COVID-19 and its variants in an animal model, establishing the potential for future development in Phase 1/2 clinical trials into a drug candidate. The broader societal impact of this project will be to advance a new treatment for both COVID-19 and future coronavirus pandemics, which will help stem future outbreaks and save lives, while helping to mitigate the dire economic consequences of the continuing pandemic and its after-effects.

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The ability to change functional traits is thought to benefit animals that live in rapidly changing environments. However, little research has focused on how slow-growing, long-lived species may use physiological changes to withstand environmental stress that occurs over long timespans. White sturgeon, one of the largest freshwater fish in North America, can live upwards of 100 years. Sturgeon populations in the Fraser River, British Columbia, are considered threatened or endangered due to overfishing. As efforts increase to restock sturgeon in the Fraser River, it is important to understand how these fish may tolerate environmental stress, and what genetic components may produce climate change \u201cwinners\u201d. The Fellow will investigate if flexibility in functional traits can help buffer a long-lived species from future environmental change. The Fellow will gain critical research experience during the study, ranging from transcriptomics to whole-animal performance, as well as involving students from diverse backgrounds in research activities.<br/>  <br/>This project uses a paired design, wherein individual sturgeon will be assessed for characteristics of tolerance and performance across biological levels of organization. Individuals will undergo a series of environmental stress tests to determine thermal and low oxygen (hypoxia) tolerance and understand if tolerance is consistent across stressors. In addition, individual aerobic performance will be measured to determine whether tolerance is functionally beneficial for this species. Furthermore, genetic, biochemical, and tissue-level metrics will be assessed to determine what anchors whole-animal tolerance and performance. Comparative physiologists have long been captivated by the mechanistic underpinnings of thermal and hypoxia tolerance. The sheer diversity of fish species has limited unifying explanations that could explain the linkage between thermal and oxygen limitations. Therefore, it is imperative to characterize and understand thermal and hypoxia tolerance of a long-lived species previously unstudied in this context to further understanding of these processes. Furthermore, understanding which genes produce favorable phenotypes can help conservation initiatives to identify stress-tolerant white sturgeon. The Fellow plans to partner with local conservation and education initiatives to disseminate the findings of this research beyond academia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The overarching objective of this research was to understand how long-lived, late-maturing species, already threatened and endangered by human impacts, respond to environmental stressors. During the award period, different populations of white sturgeon, a representative long-lived fish, were investigated to understand how they cope with warming and low oxygen stress, and what mechanisms may underlie their responses. Collaborations created during the fellowship expanded the scope of the research. The fellow worked with the Nechako White Sturgeon Conservation Centre to assess how a critically endangered population of white sturgeon respond to heatwaves and longer, warmer summer conditions that are occurring due to global warming. The fellow was awarded a Company of Biologists Travelling Fellowship to incorporate a southern population of white sturgeon into the research and was hosted by Dr. Nann Fangue at the University of California Davis (UC Davis). At UC Davis, the fellow investigated how prolonged exposure to warming may impact sturgeon vulnerability to low oxygen. The fellow also initiated collaborations between UBC and the Fraser River Sturgeon Conservation Society to establish work on temperature effects in the field, using non-lethal sampling techniques. These continued collaborations will leverage samples collected in-lab by the fellow to develop a better understanding of whole animal responses in the field. Collectively, these data will provide insight into the environmental limitations of white sturgeon across populations to help inform conservation efforts.   Furthermore, the fellow was fortunate to mentor three undergraduate research projects during this award period. This included a year-long Directed Studies project, investigating how sturgeon cope during the return to cool temperatures after prolonged warming, which has resulted in the students first-author publication. This also included a timely undergraduate Honours Thesis project, prompted by a sturgeon mortality event in September 2022. In this project, the student characterized how together, low oxygen and feeding may impact how the fishdeals with acute warming. This helped inform subsequent studies in collaboration between UBC and the Fraser River Sturgeon Conservation Society. In addition, the fellow was awarded a grant to provide an undergraduate stipend for a short-term project through the Biology Undergraduate Diversity in Research (BUDR) program at UBC. In this project, the student investigated how gills may play a role in tolerating warm temperatures. The fellow also served as BUDR academic mentor for four undergraduate students.   This research has resulted in one student-led publication and is expected to produce at least 4 additional publications. In addition, the award allowed the fellow to produce 5 peer-reviewed publications, 1 book chapter, 8 popular science communication articles, and 3 manuscripts under review, from collaborations established during the tenure of the fellowship and from previous research. The fellow was able to present this research at local, national, and international conferences, and co-hosted a symposium on multiple stressor research at the Society for Experimental Biology Centenary Meeting 2023 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Beyond research, the fellow was able to engage in meaningful professional development and education opportunities, taking advantage of programs at UBC such as Instructional Skills Workshop for Faculty and the Summer Institute in Project Management. In addition, the fellow collaborated with UBC Let's Talk Science to create a lesson plan for Chat with a Climate Scientist, where an interactive, sturgeon-focused lesson was implemented for multiple elementary classes via Zoom. During the award period, the fellow was offered a tenure-track assistant professor position, which began immediately after the end of the award.

        "abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly customizable, programmable system that allows researchers to program and run experiments across wide-ranging use cases. Physical- and life-science R&amp;D personnel frequently conduct repetitive, long-duration experiments manually with unconnected benchtop equipment. A tailored flexible automation system would serve multiple industries, including chemicals, specialty polymers, and biotechnology. The goal is to optimize the flexibility that researchers need to complete their studies while minimizing the efforts they expend on equipment and development customization. This system will bring the benefits of automation found in large-scale manufacturing facilities to the laboratory benchtop-scale in terms of (1) decoupling researchers\u2019 time from their productivity and (2) enabling modern programmatic approaches for collaborating and building directly upon previously programmed protocols. This will accelerate the research and development enterprise. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is the development and commercialization of a system that makes laboratory protocol automation accessible to researchers. The system will make automation accessible by addressing the most difficult elements of system integration (communication timing, command timing, a user-interface, data persistence) so that researchers need only focus on the protocols. The system hardware unifies the disparate types of input and output (I/O) for multiple types of benchtop lab equipment. The software front-end provides an accessible Python application programming interface (API) for the network of connected equipment. The software application handles command queuing and execution for a user\u2019s customized script. Used in combination, these capabilities result in a flexible network of plug-and-play laboratory devices that seamlessly communicate with each other to execute complex protocols. The research objectives are to 1) establish a robust and scalable software and hardware architecture, and 2) develop, test, and implement assets to accelerate user adoption. The anticipated result is a system that enables a researcher to select any combination of benchtop lab equipment from the device library, configure the equipment into a custom setup, select and modify template protocols, and execute specialized protocols in a matter of minutes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "      This Project Outcomes Report summarizes the achievements of this SBIR Phase II project focused on developing a modular and reconfigurable liquid-handling toolkit for laboratory research. The project aimed to improve the way research is conducted in laboratories by creating a highly customizable and programmable system that simplifies automation for benchtop research.   The project has resulted in a flexible, modular system that allows researchers to more easily automate their benchtop laboratory processes. This system comprises both hardware and software components that enable integration and communication among various types of laboratory equipment, from balances and pumps to sensors and more. Key features of the system include:     Simple, Flexible Scripting: The system uses the Python programming language for scripting, enabling users to program their laboratory processes. The flexibility of Python, combined with the Aqueduct API, allows for tailored experimental setups and protocols.     Built-In System and Data Visualization: The system's interface provides visual representations of hardware and includes features for live plotting and graphing. This facilitates experiment control and monitoring with the option for interface customization.     Simulation of Processes without Hardware: The platform can simulate the behavior of hardware components, allowing for the development and testing of processes without physical equipment. This includes the ability to simulate variable conditions, aiding in the refinement of experiments.     Ecosystem for Rapid Development: The system includes libraries and recipes for specific applications, along with code snippets and templates. This supports quicker development and customization of experiments.     Over the duration of the project, the system has seen real-world use in various laboratory processes, including:     Tangential/Cross-Flow Filtration: The system was used to implement automated control of pumps and valves and to collect real-time data to enable accurate process monitoring and analysis.     pH Control: Automated pH adjustments in specific chemical reactions, such as the methacrylation of hyaluronic acid, through precise control algorithms.     Dispensing and Formulation: Enabled the control of syringe pumps for accurate dispensing and formulation and was integrated with an external robotic system to automate reaction kinetics studies.     The intellectual merit of the work lies in its approach to automation, where it has addressed significant challenges in system integration, such as communication timing and command execution, that typically hinder the automation of laboratory protocols. The system not only enhances the efficiency of research operations but also improves the accuracy and reproducibility of experimental results. By enabling the execution of user-customized scripts and facilitating the development of a growing device library, the system supports a wide range of research activities across the physical and life sciences.   The project's outcomes have implications across various fields, potentially speeding up research and development activities. By making laboratory automation more accessible, the toolkit can benefit research in healthcare, biotechnology, and materials science. The ability to simulate experiments and utilize a flexible scripting language also contributes to a reduction in the time and resources needed for experimental setup and execution.   Furthermore, our project promotes the democratization of science by making advanced research tools more accessible to a wider range of laboratories, including those with limited resources. This inclusivity fosters a more diverse scientific community, encouraging collaboration and the sharing of knowledge across different fields and disciplines.

Increasingly, the importance of T cells, both cytotoxic and Helper T cells and their rapid responses to infection are recognized as critical to priming effective, cross-protective and durable immune responses to SARS CoV-2 and other endemic and emerging viral and bacterial infectious diseases. Our pan-species/pan-disease platform comprises clinically relevant T cell antigens that mirror pathogen antigens presented to T cells on naturally infected cells formulated in calcium phosphate nanoparticles a safe, dose-sparing, nonviral, adjuvant for needle-free administration.  In Phase i, we cloned genes representing the complete SARS CoV2 genome, made recombinant full-length proteins from each gene and used the proteins to stimulate T cells in blood from human donors to identify groups of SARS proteins recognized by donor T cells that were stimulated by natural exposure to the virus.  The genes for these proteins will be incorporated into  an experimental DNA plasmid vaccine for more extensive Phase 2 testing in animal models. The objective is to identify conserved antigens that are protective against all existing and emerging SARS CoV2 variants, to reduce or eliminate the need to create new antibody-generating vaccines each time a new variant arises in the population. More broadly, we use SARS CoV2, still an infectious virus of global concern, as the template pathogen to develop a vaccine platform that can be used to create vaccines for human infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and herpesviruses. The concept of vaccines that stimulate T cell immunity has the potential to disrupt the animal health vaccine market where state-of-the-art is Jenner-type vaccines based on 40+ year old technology. We are applying knowledge gained in this Phase I SARS CoV2 project  to extend the T cell vaccine platform to create new, next-generation veterinary vaccines, including the pandemic African Swine Fever Virus, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, Bovine Tuberculosis and Equine herpesvirus 1.

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This project aims to understand the ways in which animals are connected within a community and how connectivity may help animals remain healthier even under stressful conditions. The community of bacteria within an animal\u2019s gut, or host-associated gut microbiome, provides a unique system in which to test these ideas: the gut microbiome provides a number of important functions (digests food, produces vitamins, and trains the immune system) but also changes rapidly in response to an animal\u2019s environment, social interactions, and diet. In order to balance natural microbial sharing processes and experimental manipulation, the Fellow will create a model aquatic system consisting of three species of frogs that naturally overlap in their wild habitat. By altering the frogs\u2019 social and environmental conditions and examining how their gut microbiomes change, the Fellow will be able to disentangle one mechanism of community connectivity that could buffer animals against environmental stress. In addition, the use of amphibians in this research has important conservation implications: amphibians are often used as an indicator of ecosystem health, but are declining globally due to habitat degradation and increased disease prevalence. Understanding the mechanisms that govern amphibian health provides important context for management decisions of at-risk species. Throughout this project, the Fellow will mentor students from historically underrepresented groups, as well as work with existing institutional departments to create K-12 teaching module(s) for use in local public schools.<br/><br/>This research tests whether the transfer of gut microbes, especially across host individuals and species, could be primarily driven by metacommunity processes. Specifically, ecological processes such as dispersal between hosts or environments have been shown to be important drivers of microbiome assembly, and limiting dispersal can significantly alter community composition. In a multi-species context, this project can extend the traditional use of community ecological theory in microbiome research to a metacommunity approach, treating individual hosts and host species as \u201cpatches\u201d and tracking ecological and evolutionary processes (dispersal, selection, priority effects) within or between patches. By creating a tractable aquatic system in which to compare the relative importance of these eco-evolutionary processes, the Fellow will apply hypotheses proposed by metacommunity models to the microbiome and thus identify causal drivers of gut microbial assembly. Through this project, the Fellow will receive training in the fields of animal physiology, experimental biology, ecology, and genomics, as well as STEM education through the creation of K-12 teaching module(s) focused on beneficial microbes and amphibian conservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In order to balance natural microbial sharing processes and experimental manipulation, the fellow attempted to create a model aquatic system consisting of three species of frogs that naturally overlap in their wild habitat.   Intellectual Merit. During the award period the PI worked towards two main scientific objectives: (1) developing the aquatic study system, (2) piloting the social and environmental stressor experiments. During the summer of 2022, the fellow encountered difficulties in breeding two of the wild species, but was successful in rearing two clutches of green frog tadpoles to Gosner stage 25 (free swimming, eating), consisting of well over 2,000 animals. The PI also worked towards developing the protocols necessary to breed bullfrogs and tree frogs. These animals were brought back to the University of Pittsburghs (Pitt) main campus in order to pilot the social and environmental stressor experiments in single species assemblages. With these animals, we piloted experiments. We determined the housing conditions that would best achieve the experimental objectives and were able to test the relationship between gut microbial composition and the interaction between harmful algal bloom toxin and temperature. These samples remain at Pitt for analysis by future undergraduate/graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.   Broader Impacts. During my summer fieldwork at PLE, the PI had the opportunity to (1) individually mentor two senior undergraduates as research assistants (RAs) well as (2) co-develop a Research Experience for Undergraduates field program. The RAs working with me also both participated in this program and had all the professional development opportunities afforded the REU students. Mentoring RAs. We advertised the position on the Pitt undergraduate work-study website and the PI interviewed all applicants. When deciding between students, the PI opted for students who had not previously been able to develop in-person research skills due to the pandemic. The PI met with the RAs individually at least weekly and worked closely with them every day to execute my project as well as learn and aid in their professional development goals. Both RAs were also offered the opportunity of developing and testing an independent project: one RA was interested in behavioral ecology and the PI assisted in her developing an independent project testing feeding competition in our tadpoles, and the other RA opted to learn about bioinformatics and coding and was given some Kohl lab data the PI had previously analyzed (so that the PI could easily guide him with any issues) with which to practice. Both RAs presented posters at the REU poster session at the end of the summer. Developing an REU Program. The PI co-developed an REU program with one other postdoctoral researcher and the assistance of the PLE administration. The PI created a syllabus based on professional development topics aimed at uncovering the hidden curriculum of academia that guided our discussions through a number of topics including how to apply to graduate school, contact mentors, attend conferences, and find funding for and in graduate school, and facilitated making contacts outside the program (and university) through career panels. We read and discussed scientific papers weekly and facilitated different cohort building activities so that we could create a small community of undergraduate researchers at the field station. For this inaugural year, we had six total participants (including the RAs working with me) ranging from rising sophomores to rising seniors working on a variety of topics in ecology and evolution, each of which presented a poster at the end of the summer.   Training and Professional Development Outcomes. This fellowship afforded a number of training and professional development opportunities, including the opportunity to develop an independent research program at a field station, an REU program, and skills in animal husbandry and care. The PI had never worked at a field station a long period before and the PI had the opportunity to develop her own protocols with the support of dedicated field station staff. In developing the REU program, the PI had never developed a full syllabus before, and because of the small number of students we could make the curriculum very flexible to fit their professional development goals. This project also provided an opportunity to develop animal husbandry skills with a new taxonomic class so that the PI could broaden my skill set in preparation for future job opportunities.

This NSF project goals are to ensure that this change is done in a way that is fair and technically sound, considering the need and well-being of all, done in a way that ultimately provides a more resilient and equitable society.  The project is transformative by bringing together a broad team of researchers from four universities, coupled with a diverse group of outside advisors, to focus on sustainable transportation electrification in Texas, a state that is extremely diverse and has its own electric grid.  The goals will be achieved by utilizing the team\u2019s broad expertise in the many different areas needed to ensure success. The intellectual merits include fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion, developing criteria for success, developing the required research and education agenda, and doing pilot studies.  The broader impacts of the project include helping to guide the equitable, sustainable and resilient electrification of transportation by engaging with a wide variety of partners, including government, community organizations and the business community.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to develop a convergent team and associated proposal focused on the sustainable, equitable and resilient electrification of transportation. This is needed because society is beginning a massive transformation as the electric grid becomes much more renewable and as transportation becomes much more electrified. The convergent work proposed here is to ensure that this transformation is done so as to benefit all members of society. The specific focus is the supra-aggregation associated with the connected urban-rural systems in the electric grid covering most of the state of Texas, with results applicable to the rest of the country. The team has broad expertise in the many required areas including the electric grid, renewable generation, transportation, urban studies, community planning, sociology, risk analysis, large-scale computing and data analytics, demographics, and education. The portfolio of research and education will be broad, leveraging the strengths of the convergent team with key aspects including developing better modeling and simulation, developing theories of change and more generalization theories, broad stakeholder participation, and equity with the goal of advancing knowledge. The effort has a strong focus on education to all, and should result in overall societal benefit given its broad focus on the electric and transportation infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The PIs at UTSA piloted a mentoring program for undergraduate education and engineering students majoring in education and engineering. Acurriculum and companion electric car kit created by the PIs and an undergraduate group at UTSA were piloted at an elementary school.   We developed an algorithmic framework to compute accurate estimates of time and position in GPS receivers that are attacked by spoofers.   We found a very detailed report from NREL entitled \"The 2030 NationalCharging Network:, Estimating U.S. Light-Duty Demand forElectric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure\". In the executive summary, private, at home charging is seen as the base of the infrastructure, with publicly accessible level 2 charging stations providing the middle ground and public fast charging stations (150kW today projected to 350 kW) being the tip of the pyramid.

        "abstractText": "Heart Failure (HF) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Recently, a new medical device therapy called Cardiac Contractility Modulation (CCM) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used in eligible HF patients. CCM devices are implantable electrical pulse generators that deliver stimulations to the heart to increase the strength of the heart contraction during HF. The true benefit of these devices has not been reached due to a lack of predictive human-based preclinical test methods. The goal of this one-year NSF/FDA Scholar-in-Residence program is to develop a 3D Printed Human Heart Model to predict the effects of cardiac electrophysiology medical devices (e.g., CCM) at the bench. This model has a potential to reduce the burden on animal testing and clinical trials for cardiacmedical device development and may inform FDA regulatory review process and ultimately accelerate heart failure patients access to innovative, safe and effective devices. This study will partner faculty and students at the University of Maryland and regulatory scientists at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) at the FDA.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to develop a robust high-throughput 3D printed (3DP) engineered heart tissue (EHT) model composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC CMs) and to apply this model to preclinical assessment of human cardiac electrophysiology medical devices in vitro. Specifically, we will leverage our previous experience and development of a cell adhesion centrifugation (CAC) assay to investigate its utility for generating EHTs in a quantity sufficient to support high-throughput regulatory studies. This model will be used to elucidate the acute effects of Cardiac Contractility Modulation (CCM) therapy medical devices on human cardiac function in vitro. As such we will investigate the functional consequences of clinical CCM stimulation parameters on 3DP EHTs and quantify the response for all three cardiac excitation-contraction coupling readouts (i.e., electrophysiology, calcium handling, and contraction) in a high-throughput manner. The work described in this project will address current regulatory knowledge gaps and demonstrate the utility of hiPSC-CM 3DP EHT constructs to assess safety and effectiveness of cardiac electrophysiology medical devices in vitro.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The current manufacturing process is limited to a moderate success rate (40-60%) and is a manual and time-intensive, skill-dependent process. To solve these limitations, 3D inkjet printing was utilized as it provides a skill-independent, consistent, high-throughput, semi-automated process.  The goal of this project was to create a semi-automated process similar to the current manual process of manufacturing ECTs by hand. Although there the success rate of 3DP ECTs was low, there was useful information gained that will assist work in the future. This work included a discussion of the printers used, print characterizations for Matrigel, difficulties, and an experiment overview.  Future work should include changing the base material, print needle gauge size, and methodology of incorporating the fibrinogen-thrombin matrix.  To troubleshoot the difference in compaction between manufactured-by-hand ECTs and 3DP ECTs, future work will include examining different print materials, including gelatin methacrylate (GelMa) and collagen, and examining the effect of different gauge print needles to reduce the impact of Matrigel-fibrinogen crosslinking. Changing the primary material will hopefully improve print consistency. Additionally, different ways to include the fibrinogen-thrombin matrix in the well will be examined. Currently, it is planned to use CFs to elucidate these issues, and CMs will be reintroduced as more of these issues are resolved.       Last Modified: 02/05/2023       Submitted by: John P Fisher",

        "abstractText": "Remote work practices, which have been greatly accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will likely play an increased role in post-pandemic work and life for many businesses and their employees. While there are benefits to remote work for some, if remote work persists to a significant degree, it may lead to \u201chollow towns\u201d wherein city centers experience a serious decline in the absence of office workers. This trend is placing American cities in peril and threatening the livelihoods of many lower-income service workers who depend on people\u2019s coming to the city core to work, shop, and conduct business. This phenomenon is in stark contrast to the pre-pandemic era when cities served as hubs of innovation and economic activities, but also suffered from negative externalities such as traffic congestion and vehicular emissions. This project will build capacity toward designing more desirable future of work scenarios where workplace decisions by skilled workers, i.e., those who can work remotely, can be coordinated across firms in such a manner that the vibrancy of the city as an economic catalyst and an innovation hub is maintained; local businesses and service workers thrive; and traffic congestion is reduced. If successful, this  Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier (FW-HTF) Planning Grant project will advance the national well-being by helping to retain inner-city service jobs, generate opportunities to re-train service workers, and help maintain American cities' long-standing reputation as economically vibrant clusters of innovation, while mitigating the negative externalities that have plagued city centers for decades.<br/><br/>The project has three thrusts: 1) conduct preliminary analyses to quantify the impacts of increasing levels of remote work on local economy and inner-city service workers; 2) perform exploratory work to understand firms\u2019 responses to alternative policy options that cities may implement to optimize worker presence; and 3) engage stakeholders to assess policy feasibility and their attitudes towards and trust in using technologies to optimize worker presence in offices. The project will focus on Seattle and Phoenix, two cities with very different spatial distributions of economic activities. A novel hierarchical Stackelberg game framework will be developed by leveraging knowledge from behavioral economics, as well as methods in neural networks and evolutionary programming, to model firm behavior in a realistic but uncertain environment. Critical thresholds at which city centers may hollow out and potential early warning signals will be investigated. The project will lay the groundwork in generating new methods and knowledge at the intersection of operations research, economics, public policy, and transportation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Major outcomes associated with each of the three project aims are described below:   1) Understand how an increasing degree of remote work may affect the local economy and inner-city service workers;   a) Proximity and face-to-face interaction are critical in both improving productivity in teamwork and urban vitality as an innovation hub and an economic catalyst. Our analysis of more than 10 metropolitan regions show that local service industries rely heavily on commuters coming to downtown to work.   b) Local consumer services were more impacted in downtown areas than in rural areas. More specifically, the food and drink industry are particularly negatively impacted by remote work. Using Seattle as a case study, we showed that the number of POI visits at Seattle downtown is attributed to people both reducing their POI visits in general and substituting the downtown POIs with the same type of POIs in other neighborhoods. For example, if the center of a neighborhood is 1 mile from the center of Downtown Seattle, about 15% of the decreased number of visits to Downtown Seattle will be shifted to that neighborhood.   2) Formulate city policies and incentive structures for individual businesses (primarily companies whose employees have the resources and capability to work remotely);   We developed a novel hierarchical framework to optimize city policies and incentives related to remote work. This framework recognized that companies may react uniquely to policies, each with its distinct valuation of gains or losses, by incorporating the prospect theory to articulate the utility function for individual companies, capturing their subjective decision-making behavior. We also encountered many challenges, which primarily related to complex interplay of many factors, including the dynamic nature of the business environment, complications in employer-employee relationships, and the continuous evolution of external influences. These challenges, which continually evolved during the project period, have made us re-evaluate the suitability of using the proposed Stackelberg game framework to model the complex remote to work policies by companies, and the consequent behaviors by employees.   3) Engage and build partnerships with relevant stakeholders in both Seattle and Phoenix.   On April 19th, 2023, together with Puget Sound Regional Council, the UW team conducted a future of downtown Seattle summit, involving a wide range of the stakeholders in the region. The summit focused on near-term needs, as well as the role of innovations and emerging technologies, for reactivating the central core of the city and region in the aftermath of the pandemic.   Activity #1. Setting the Scene: Our respective dreams and plans   Participants identified three dimensions for the future of downtown Seattle in 10 years.    Vibrant and active. A welcoming downtown for everyone, attracting locals and tourists, that has vibrant and active spaces, is clean and easy to get around, and has things to do throughout the day and night (18hr Downtown).    Improved social services. A downtown with housing options for all income levels and household sizes, social services to meet behavioral health needs, and a safe environment for residents and visitors.    Efficient transportation. A transportation system prioritizing pedestrians, cyclists, transit users, and other efficient modes was mentioned to support lots of people getting to, from, and around downtown.   Activity #2  What type of place could Downtown Seattle be in the next 3-5 years?   Participants summary responses are: lively, diverse, and filled with opportunities for entertainment, socializing, and cultural experiences.   Activity #3  What type of place could Downtown Seattle be?   Common themes that emerged from the three group discussions include:   o Considering diverse activities,   o Considering the needs of both residents and families and visitors;   o Promoting non-driving transportation options;   o Addressing challenges related to safety, unhoused individuals;   o Supporting small businesses.   Activity #4  Who do we want to engage?   Participants described people or groups who are relatively well-resourced or privileged, visitors who come downtown for specific purposes, some who need to access public services, and workers who live far away or have schedules outside of the weekday 9-to-5 periods.   Activity #5  How can people get to downtown?   Participants prioritized responsiveness and seamless transfers as two key areas for improvement for our transit system. Barriers are also identified: a) large share of remote work in downtown (50%); b) reliance on cars; c) lack of engagement of diverse communities and youth; and d) need to restore culture, art and music in downtown Seattle.   Activity #6  Reflection   Participants envisioned a sustainable, connected, and inclusive place, with a focus on collaboration, improved services, and innovative solutions. They highlighted the importance of understanding public preferences, addressing existing challenges, adapting to evolving travel patterns, fostering collaboration among stakeholders, seizing immediate opportunities, and supporting a thriving arts and culture scene. Lastly Participants expressed the need for inclusivity, utilizing technology effectively, harnessing the power of social media, addressing lighting concerns, and enhancing public transportation information for light rail users.

Many methods used to diagnose disease are limited by the methods used to process patient samples. Commonly used processes can disrupt or destroy disease markers present in samples, leading to concerns about diagnostic dependability and accuracy. The proposed product platform can address this pain point by retaining disease markers as well as increasing yields which results in higher-fidelity experimental results and ultimately, enhances diagnostic medicine.<br/><br/>The proposed project will advance the development of a transformational biotechnology platform which non-destructively detaches adherent mammalian cells from a cell dish surface. Existing methods can damage these cells and are highly varied in cell yields which greatly limit clinical applications for disease diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. To fulfill its promise as a highly compelling alternative to existing methods, the following technical hurdles will be addressed in this project: 1) determining the optimal composition and design of the material, 2) validating the effects of the platform on cells, 3) using fabrication methods conducive to manufacturing purposes, and 4) benchmarking its performance against existing Flow Cytometry methods for adherent cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

At present, Flow Cytometry is primarily used for non-adherent cell types (such as blood) whereas applications with adherent cell types (such as solid tissue biopsy) are limited because of the complex steps involved in their use. The intellectual merit for this project lies in its advancement of the development of a transformational biotechnology platform which non-destructively detaches adherent mammalian cells from a cell dish surface. Existing methods can damage these cells and are highly varied in cell yields which greatly limit clinical applications for disease diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. We demonstrated a compelling alternative to existing methods by overcoming technical hurdles including the optimal composition and design of the material, validation of the effects of the platform on cells, using fabrication methods conducive to manufacturing purposes, and benchmarking its performance against existing Flow Cytometry methods for adherent cells. With these tasks accomplished, the broader impacts of these outcomes make possible new health diagnostics, advanced personalized medicine, and accelerated research for diseases specific to adherent cells (many types of cancers). These successes empower the company to continue its mission to develop promising academic research into commercial products and services which directly enhances partnerships between academia and industry. Finally, the company has increased the number of internships for university students in service to the expansion of participation of women and individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM.

        "abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an intelligent software maintenance technology that focuses on improvement of the software and systems that underpin our national infrastructure and drive our economy. It is estimated corporations are spending over $300 billion per year globally, paying down \u201ctechnical debt\u201d on addressing issues related to maintaining legacy systems or dealing with bad software. By adopting the proposed technology, software development teams will avoid critical bugs that, in turn, will avoid financial loss. The proposed technology will help chief technology officers (CTOs) and chief information officers (CIOs)  - not only developers - carry out several critical activities including: gaining actionable insight into the state of their code; accurately estimating the scope and cost of code cleanup; and assessing code quality trends and how to repair these code quality issues. By carrying out these activities, the proposed technology will decrease the time, cost, and risk of code cleanup while improving team performance.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an intelligent refactoring bot that may be easily integrated into any project repository. The bot may be customized to monitor the quality in the repository after a number of pull-requests. The bot analyzes the changed files to identify refactoring opportunities using a set of quality attributes.  It will then find the best sequence of refactorings to fix the quality issues, if any. The developer is able to review the recommendations in the generated pull-request. The initial proof-of-concept of the proposed interactive refactoring software was tested on 12 large-scale, open-source, and industrial systems with a total of 37 developers from industry. The technology reduced the amount of time that developers spent to understand existing large-scale source code by an average of 47%. Existing refactoring products, when tested on the same systems, were able to reduce that time by less than 24% on average. In addition, the technology was able to detect and fix an average of 92% of existing design defects in these systems. In contrast, existing refactoring products were able to only detect an average of less than 76% of these defects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  The proposed technology focuses on issues of great economic impact: improvement of the software that underpins our national infrastructure and drives our economy.   The goal of this I-Corps project was to evaluate the commercial viability of the proposed automated software quality monitoring and improvement technology based on AI/ML rather than the current traditional tools that propose a manual support with few supported programming languages. This proposed effort focused on customer discovery activities including the identification of relevant organizations for the interviews, market assessment, refining the value propositions, etc. Through the I-Corps program, the team assessed the market to determine the size of the market that would use our tool via over a large number of interviews performed both remote and in-person.   In the performed wide-scale customer discovery survey, the team targeted software developers and their team along with technical management. The project outcomes found that the detection and correction of design defects as well as quality and security issues are extremely critical for large-scale software projects to keep the risk of failure risk low and to boost the productivity of programmers. Even though there has been a lot of work both by the software engineering researchers and practitioners, the existing tool support is limited to providing code metrics, issues, or smells. Some of the existing tools provide refactoring support; however, the process of refactoring is strictly manual and hence not suitable to integrate with continuous integration mechanisms/platforms.   Based on this I-Corps project, the team received followup funding along forming a startup to enhance the development of our refactoring technology. The team explored some subscription plans with several companies based on the outcomes of our pilots. These licensing plans are depending on the size of the repositories to be analyzed in terms of code size, number of programmers, number of commits, etc. The team continue to explore opportunities with commercial partners who are willing to help fund the development efforts in order to help them address their significant technical debt more quickly, by paying for beta products and applied research projects.
