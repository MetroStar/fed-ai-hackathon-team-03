        "abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a medical device capable of diagnosing Pulsatile Tinnitus (PT) by measuring hemodynamic changes within the brain\u2019s venous outflow tract. Currently, PT evaluation takes 4 - 6 hours and consists of diagnostic cerebral angiography, diagnostic cerebral venography, venous manometry, and balloon occlusion tests all performed essentially without any sedation to provide operators with the best guess of where the sound is originating. Rather than relying on patients to relay to the physician their experience, the proposed device is designed to directly measure pressure fluctuations causing sound and provide a map of sound overlying the patient\u2019s vasculature that physicians will interpret. The proposed technology may obviate painful balloon occlusion tests and venous manometry and shorten procedural time to a more reasonable 30 minutes. Over 3 million Americans are estimated to have PT, and 65% of them suffer from debilitating depression, anxiety, or both. A reliable diagnosis may allow neurointerventional physicians to treat their symptoms and improve outcomes. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a diagnostic microcatheter medical device to diagnose Pulsatile Tinnitus (PT).  The proposed device is designed with one or more embedded transducers that can convert the pressure fluctuations of sound generated in blood vessels into electrical signals and provide a map of sound generation directly to the neuroendovascular surgeon in real-time with both visual and audible feedback.  Analogous to electrophysiology mapping of the heart, the proposed technology provides physicians with an objective map of pressure waves (correlating to sound production) within the vasculature and enables the diagnosis. Proof of concept has been evaluated using a prototype system with an off-the-shelf microphone chip embedded at its distal tip that is able to directly detect PT sounds using benchtop flow models derived from patient-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data before and after treatments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Pulsatile Tinnitus is the perception of a loud, rhythmic sound synchronous with the heartbeat, which can have a dangerous vascular cause and lead to debilitating depression or anxiety in patients. Unlike continuous tinnitus, pulsatile tinnitus is treatable if the underlying vascular cause is correctly identified.   During the NSF I-Corps program, our team explored the potential commercialization of intracranial phonocatheter technology as a diagnostic tool for Pulsatile Tinnitus (PT). Our experience, including 115 interviews over seven weeks, highlighted a significant need for a device that can swiftly and precisely identify the source of PT symptoms, aid in treatment decisions, and rule out the most dangerous causes. Additionally, the I-Corps program helped us understand the broader customer ecosystem, identify key activities, partners, and resources, and formulate a business model to determine the feasibility of commercializing Phonocath.   The current standard of care to evaluate PT takes 4-6 hours and involves numerous tests, all performed without sedation so the patient can report their symptoms to clinicians during the procedure. This process is often painful for patients and cumbersome for clinicians. The Intracranial Phonocatheter (Phonocath) is a diagnostic device that can provide a real-time map of sound generated in blood vessels within the brain to the clinicians. This technology was developed primarily at the University of California, San Francisco. Instead of relying on patients to accurately recall their symptoms, the Phonocath objectively detects the source of PT and reduces procedural time to about 30 minutes.   Over 3 million Americans are estimated to have PT, and 65% of them suffer from debilitating depression, anxiety, or both. One broader impact of our Phonocath technology is to provide patients suffering from PT with a reliable diagnosis, leading to timely treatment and essentially giving them back their lives. This will alleviate a tremendous loss of earnings opportunity for millions of Americans.        Last Modified: 07/12/2024       Submitted by: MatthewRAmans",

By performing a scientific study of how children engage with content on the device relative to the same content in paper and tablet form, this project seeks to prove the benefits of alternative, screenless, interactive learning. The project leverages fundamental educational science.  It also has the potential to improve public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology in the United States while offering important health benefits by reducing screen addiction in young children. Excessive screen time has been linked to a range of negative health outcomes, including increased risk of obesity, decreased sleep quality, and impaired social and emotional development. The project has the potential to generate significant revenue by commercializing the device both directly to consumers and through partnerships with schools.<br/><br/>This project will see the development of an innovative, screenless learning tool for young children, by seamlessly integrating technology into a traditional book format. The proposed platform consists of three major components: a book cover that houses swappable book inserts, embedded electronics that play audio in response to a page touch, and software that powers interactions and connectivity. A microcontroller recognizes an inserted paper book and offers a personalized interactive experience using content stored on the device. Button icons printed on the book pages line up precisely with a physical button grid embedded in the device, supporting learning activities. The success of this project requires the development of three hardware components and three software components that seamlessly work together in a connected ecosystem.

        "projectOutComesReport": "  This NSF SBIR Phase I award supported research and development to create machine learning powered actors (ML actors) to improve connectedness in virtual spaces. Witnessing a shift towards remote work and socialization, and inspired by research showing AI characters can be a powerful tool for building empathy and connection, we set out to demonstrate we could train ML actors that were effective facilitators of social connection. Over the course of the award, we demonstrated that we could use a new approach to automated planning, a large multi-modal task network planner, to control the behavior of virtual characters in 3D environments. In parallel, we demonstrated that non-technical users can create dialogue and behaviors for this novel planning system- a result that has significant implications for broadening participation in the creation and utilization of AI powered characters.   Our research plan centered on three key technical objectives, each of which was successfully completed over the course of the award. First, we proved that we could effectively train a large multi-modal task network planner on vast quantities of data while requiring minimal human intervention in the training process. Second, we demonstrated that large multi-modal task network planners can power character behaviors in 3D environments- producing highly varied, engaging user experiences. Finally, results of testing the authoring system with non-technical users demonstrate that it is feasible for users of varied technical skill levels to create and customize characters powered by large multi-modal task network planners. The resulting innovation of our research and development is a system for producing fully formed ML actors that can navigate an array of situations in different virtual environments and are customizable by users of no technical ability. This innovation has significant implications for the development of video games, training simulations, media and entertainment.   At the onset of the award, we hypothesized that our solution would initially be commercialized through products aimed at helping remote teams stay connected socially. This hypothesis was developed when the landscape of remote work looked much different than it does today. Informed by new data that shows organizations are shifting to hybrid or in person models of work, we explored new markets for commercialization. Over the course of the award, we identified promising opportunities working with video game studios working on open world games. While we see tremendous potential for this innovation to disrupt the video game industry, AI characters that can adapt to unfamiliar spaces and myriad user choices, unlock significant advances across education, training, and skill development. The learned LMM-HTNs and knowledge graphs capture world semantics valuable to simulations outside of games, and to robotics.   This work demonstrates a new paradigm of content creation for video games and other animated or interactive media, that combines human direction and creativity with powerful workflow automation and real-time reasoning. Traditionally, developers have authored a character's physical behaviors and branching dialogue by hand, either through code or by configuring components of a decision making architecture. Architectures have progressed from simple finite state machines, to hierarchically structured behavior trees, to generative automated planning systems. However, configuration is a complex technical task requiring engineers to be involved creating bottlenecks and increasing expenses. Our approach combines recent advances in machine learning with a focus on human design and control to produce a system that is uniquely suited for use in commercial simulations while remaining inspectable, editable and controllable by users of any level of technical expertise.   Our results have significant implications for broadening participation in STEM careers particularly in fostering an interest in artificial intelligence. With the field of AI developing and expanding rapidly, it is more important than ever to foster an interest in, and understanding of, AI in young people. Our system can be a key tool for fostering this learning. Our no-code approach to character authoring enables users of any age, or level of technical expertise, to get started creating and using AI characters in virtual environments. By giving young people the opportunity to incorporate AI characters into games or virtual environments they are building, we can start them on the path to understanding how complex AI systems function and instilling a desire to learn more about the discipline.

In the broadest sense, cultural competence refers to an organization's or individual's capacity and effectiveness in engaging with individuals from cultural backgrounds different from their own. The proposed innovation seeks to create a new market for social science-inspired AI agents, with significant roles for two Historically Black College or Universities (HBCUs) in the software development. The project\u2019s impact on social advancement is crucial as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training is a high strategic priority for many organizations but often not part of the work environment. The success of the training program can lead to more equitable and inclusive workplaces, educational environments, and institutions, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and inclusive society. The project aims to increase user satisfaction and trust in AI technology, driving innovation and generating significant revenue streams by creating US jobs, annual revenue, and exports. <br/><br/>The traditional routes for developing cultural competence through human-led interventions can disrupt the work environment, be difficult to measure without human bias, and may lead to discord within the work environment. This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop culturally competent and empathetic Artificial intelligence (AI) agents to codify and label users' subjective responses to complex diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues while maintaining high social trustworthiness. Through the use of research-based social science frameworks, the project will develop bias-free and DEI-aware AI agents to assess and codify cultural competence among organizational stakeholders. Key objectives include sourcing large scale human-generated data to train AI agents to identify users' subjective responses to complex DEI observations and prompting via evocative vignettes or open-ended survey questions. Phase I aims to transform a proof-of-concept into a scalable platform with sophisticated AI capabilities for the educational marketplace, leading to more inclusive workplaces and a deeper understanding of pre-Kindergarten-20 environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a potential therapeutic treatment that promotes healing with significantly decreased scarring.  Fibrosis and scarring are the accumulation of excess extracellular matrix components, which is a pathological component of a wide spectrum of clinical indications including scleroderma and fibrosis of the heart, lung, liver, cornea, and skin. Approximately one-third of all fatalities are associated with fibrotic outcomes, which represents a significant problem and market opportunity. The initial focus of the proposed technology is corneal and dermal scarring. Cornea and skin have a similar treatment modality by administration of a topical solution. Cornea and skin may serve as model tissues for studying the pathobiology of fibrosis in all tissues, and may lead to expansion into other indications with fibrotic underpinnings such as pulmonary fibrosis, non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a self-delivery siRNA therapeutic treatment to prevent scarring and fibrosis. A genetic target has been identified that slows pathology and supports regenerative healing of wounded cornea and skin, two model tissues of fibrosis. Data show target knockdown in corneal and skin wounding models promotes regenerative healing, a type of wound healing with limited to no scarring. The current standard of care, topical administration of steroids to wounds (cornea and skin), yields unpredictable, mixed results, that vary widely between increased rates of healing, no effect, or decreased healing rates. The proposed technology uses topical administration of a siRNA that effectively penetrates cells and functions as both an anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring agent for topical wounds. The proposed therapeutic is optimized to penetrate tissues and is designed to be efficacious for 2-3 months with a single dose, which may revolutionize subretinal scarring and systemic fibrotic diseases. In addition, in vivo results in small and large animal models demonstrate efficacy and also present favorable safety profiles with no evidence of cellular/tissue toxicity, which may lead to a treatment for scarring and fibrosis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "   We are developing a novel self-delivering siRNA therapeutic as an intervention in the pathway that leads to scarring. The siRNA is highly modified to avoid degradation by proteases and, an additional cholesterol modification, provides effective delivery in tissues without additional compounds (self-delivery). Our preclinical data demonstrate one dose, administered as a topical liquid therapeutic droplet, to the cornea or skin, improves wound closure and prevents scarring and inflammation after injury and/or accelerates the rate of wound closure. Our therapeutic targets the deubiquitinase USP10. We have pioneered the connection between USP10 and scarring--identifying USP10 as a novel therapeutic target. Our invention is protected by the following: a method of use patent for the knockdown of USP10 in all wounded tissues, a pending composition of matter patent on the USP10-targeting human siRNA (DUB-001), and a provisional patent for an additional sequence and modifications for the same target. We have extensive pre-clinical data in human primary corneal cells, ex vivo porcine corneas, and in vivo murine and rabbit animal models of corneal injury. While PCED was mentioned as our clinical lead, our data supporting this specific disease when we started this program, had not yet been generated in the laboratory of Dr. Audrey Bernstein. While we anticipated, with prior scientific and clinical precedence, that the therapeutic would work in the identified indication, PCED, we also entertained other indications for FDA approval prioritizing accelerated approval timing.       As participants of the I-Corps program, we vetted Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) along the entire logistics pipeline (figure 1)which we designed to include the FDA regulatory body appropriate for our therapeutic, CDER (Center of Drug Evaluation and Research). This recognition of differences for biologic classifications resulted in a legal entity name change to DUB Therapeutics INC. (from DUB Biologics, INC.). In our customer discovery, we vetted clinicians, pharmaceutical representatives, insurance providers and regulatory consultants to narrow our focus between the ocular and dermal programs, and which reimbursement mechanism(s) should be pursued (medical benefit vs pharmaceutical benefit). We interviewed representatives for CMSleading to the identification of an appropriate CMS (Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services) for use of our asset in clinic for ocular diseases. Once identified, we continued our conversations with key decision makers, players, and potential saboteurs, to clearly map out manufacturing, distribution, and formulary approval as part of our diligence.

The conference featured presentations by international experts on the growth and assembly of materials with complex and intricate structures from individual atoms and molecules. Most of the focus topics of this conference were fundamental in nature and covered how crystals nucleate, adopt a particular shape, then grow. There were also presentations on how crystals aggregate and assemble to produce unique shapes. An area of emphasis was the synergy between cutting-edge theory and state-of-the-art experimental techniques for visualizing the atoms in crystals and the mechanisms by which crystals grow. There was a session focusing on how to grow crystals for applications in catalysis, medicine, and optical materials, for example, and how to learn from nature to produce crystals with intricate structures that cannot yet be grown in a laboratory.   Advanced materials for a wide range of applications from energy to medicine to infrastructure, depend on a fundamental understanding of crystal nucleation and growth. This conference provided a venue to bring leading scientists in crystal growth and assembly together and to provide a means for established researchers to interact with next-generation researchers to develop a tightly woven community held together by a common interest in the principles of materials assembly.    At the Crystal Growth and Assembly GRC, 34% of the attendees, 41% of the invited speakers, and 33% of the discussion leaders were women. A Power HourTM addressed diversity and inclusion in the scientific workplace by providing a safe environment for informal and meaningful conversations amongst colleagues of all career stages. The conference attendees were 82% from academia, 10% from indstry, and 8% from government labs. This mix of researchers from a wide range of backgrounds led to vibrant discssions and cemented strong relationships that promote scientific progress in understanding and applying crystal growth and assembly.

        "abstractText": "The Gordon Research Conferences has a long history of providing an international forum for the<br/>presentation and discussion of frontier research in a variety of science and engineering fields, including in coastal ocean dynamics. This project provides partial support for the Gordon<br/>Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Coastal Ocean Dynamics, to be held at the Bryant University on June 17-23, 2023. The financial support from NSF will be used to support the attendance of students, postdocs, early career researchers, invited speakers and discussion leaders, and to expand the demographic, professional and geographic diversity of participants. Coastal oceans play a major role in the Earth\u2019s system for reasons such as transforming nutrient-rich and often polluted freshwater discharge from land and dissipating large amounts of tidal energy. Understanding the processes in the coastal ocean offers great promise for linking scientific research to societal needs and to anthropogenic impact in the global ocean. Studying the interconnectedness of the physical, geological, chemical, and biological aspects of the coastal oceans is fundamental to developing sound practices for the protection of the marine ecosystem and public health. The 2023 GRC and GRS on Coastal Ocean Dynamics strives to provide a platform to foster communication on interdisciplinary thinking and nurture rapport between senior researchers and students/junior researchers. It is organized with a special emphasis on diversity and equity in gender balance, URM community representation and international participation to provide a better range of perspectives on the scientific topics.

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Advances in software engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) are providing critical and innovative capabilities across almost every domain, but the potential remains to do far more, particularly for applications that demand high levels of trustworthiness. To inform a community strategy for building and maintaining U.S. leadership in software engineering and AI engineering, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy co-hosted a two-day workshop at the National Science Foundation and the SEI Arlington facility on June 20-21, 2023.   The event gathered thought leaders from federal research funding agencies, research laboratories, mission agencies, and commercial organizations to explore the fundamental research needed to support progress toward this goal. It also included a number of students whose travel was supported through this workshop grant.   Specific objectives for the workshop included: (1) Characterize how software engineering capabilities are having a direct impact on the future of our nation. (2) Inform a community strategy for building and maintaining U.S. leadership in software engineering and AI engineering. Produce a report that summarizes challenges, opportunities, and strategic priorities. (3) Identify research questions that energize the computing community and spark new collaborations. (4) Identify updates to the CMU SEI National Agenda for Software Engineering National Study & Roadmap.   Through presentations, panel exchanges, and discussions, five themes were identified relating to the role of AI in shaping the future of software systems:   (1) AI is transforming the software engineering process and how we engineer software systems. The increasing symbiosis of humans and machines is transforming every phase of the software development lifecycle.   (2) While generative AI has reached a level of sophistication that may seem to resemble human intelligence, it is considerably harder to determine the level of trust that should be placed in the outputs.   (3) Redefining the discipline of software engineering to encompass the use of new technologies (including but not limited to generative AI) is imperative, along with rethinking the associated curricula, tools, and technologies. This effort is key to designing and building, evolving, and evaluating trustworthy software systems in a responsible, ethical way.   (4) New technologies, including generative AI, seem to hold the promise of making almost everyone a programmer. As a result, AI literacy and the development of new skills are needed throughout the workforce.   (5) The use of AI tools such as LLMs can mask the tradeoffs being made between the functionality of software systems and their safety and security. Research is needed to identify and make explicit the key engineering tradeoffs being made during the design, development, training, testing, and authorization of systems that include AI components.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Animals have many strategies for overcoming challenges in nature. When different animals share a similar solution to a problem, this is known as convergent evolution. For nutritional challenges, many animals team up with microbes, such as bacteria and fungi. The microbes can supplement the animal\u2019s diet with essential nutrients or help digest tough foods. This research will investigate if the same microbes will be present across a group of convergently-evolved ants, the honeypot ants. There are at least sixteen types of honeypot ants across the world that share a strategy for living in desert-like environments. All honeypot ant colonies have a specialized class of workers, called repletes. Repletes store food in their abdomen, sometimes swelling up to the size of a marble with all the food they store. Due to this division of labor, the repletes can provide food for the entire ant colony during the dry season, when food is in short supply. This work will characterize the composition (who is there?) and function (what are they doing?) of the microbiomes of different honeypot ants. This will result in a deeper understanding of the impacts of evolution and division of labor on microbial communities, and vice versa. Since all animals associate with microbes in some way, these results could be applied beyond ants. Also, this work will benefit society as the fellow will be sharing a charismatic and biologically interesting system in various outreach efforts. The fellow will contribute to an Ant Visitor Center and mentor undergraduate and graduate researchers at Rutgers University \u2013 Newark.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to characterize the gut microbiome of honeypot ants at multiple biological scales: 1) Gut compartments and castes of conspecifics 2) Gut compartments and castes of sympatric heterospecifics, and 3) Gut compartments and castes of allopatric heterospecifics. Using culture-dependent, culture-independent, and experimental techniques, including amplicon sequencing, isolations, whole genome sequencing, and live colony manipulation, the fellow will taxonomically and functionally characterize the microbes associated with the digestive system of honeypot ants. This project will specifically focus on Myrmecocystus spp. (North America), Tapinolepis trimenii (South Africa), and Camponotus inflatus  (Australia), as well as any other lineages that collaborators in the International Consortium of Honeypot Ant Researchers can obtain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "This award permits a doctoral dissertation student conduct environmental archaeological research to understand how people interacted with their local environments in a wetland setting. Previous studies have often linked the rise and fall of societies to improvements and deterioration in climatic patterns. Understanding these issues is critical as climate change affects countries worldwide in modern times. However, these studies tend to underestimate human and social resilience to climatic and environmental changes due to the lack of localized, fine-grained data. In this regard, environmental archaeology is particularly enlightening since it involves the collection and interpretation of environmental data in close proximity (both geographically and temporally) to archaeological discoveries. In sensitive and fragile environments such as wetlands, climate change reshapes the landscape even by a small fluctuation of precipitation and temperature. From the long-term perspective of archaeology, people adapted to the new environments through technological innovation and food diversification. This human adaptation also causes environmental consequences. This project sheds light on the complex feedback loop between human adaptation, environmental consequences, and the long-term sustainability of human-environmental interactions. The researchers aim to facilitate knowledge exchange between themselves and today's residents, deepening their understanding of managing the local environments and promoting environmental sustainability. <br/><br/>The student investigates how human behavior and settlements evolved with changing environments, particularly the fluctuating lake levels in one study area. The archaeological site is located on the edge of a highland lake, and it is one of the earliest human settlements in the region. The site was continuously occupied for over a millennium, between ~3600 and 2300 cal. BP, providing a unique opportunity to explore environmental changes before, during, and after human occupation. Due to active sedimentation and tectonic activities in the study area, archaeological deposits are buried deeply underground. To reconstruct the environmental conditions, the researchers use coring to retrieve soil samples from the past and analyze them in the laboratory. By comparing the environmental data with findings within the site, the researchers can distinguish whether changes were induced by human or climatic events and whether the changes were significant enough to render the site uninhabitable. This research fills in the gap of environmental archaeology in this part of the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Our project aimed to investigate the effects of environmental changes on the occupation and abandonment of settlements, with a specific focus on the Neolithic-Bronze Age Haimenkou site at the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. This research is significant as it provides valuable insights into how ancient communities adapted to changing environmental conditions and the long-term impacts of human activity on the landscape.   The study at Haimenkou has yielded several important findings: Over a period of 2000 years, the inhabitants of Haimenkou adapted to a changing wetland environment by introducing new domesticated plants and animals and developing bronze metallurgy. This adaptability facilitated population growth and the expansion of settlements. The development of stilt-supported houses along lake coasts and riverbanks highlights the innovative responses of ancient communities to environmental challenges. These architectural advancements allowed for sustainable living in a wetland setting. The increased demand for wood for construction and agricultural expansion led to significant deforestation, soil degradation, and landscape instability. This environmental stress contributed to landslides and the eventual abandonment of Haimenkou and neighboring settlements.   The broader impacts of this research extend beyond the academic community: The involvement of local residents in the fieldwork provided valuable insights into the historical landscape changes. In return, we shared our findings with them, fostering a mutual understanding and appreciation of the region's environmental history. Graduate students and volunteers participating in the project gained hands-on experience in core sampling, diatom analysis, and archaeological methods. This practical training will enhance their future research and career prospects.   This NSF-funded project has successfully documented the complex interactions between human communities and their environment over millennia. The findings from Haimenkou provide a valuable case study of adaptation, innovation, and the consequences of environmental exploitation. Through community engagement, educational opportunities, and laboratory enhancements, this research has achieved significant intellectual and broader impacts, contributing to our understanding of human-environment dynamics and promoting sustainable practices for the future.

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research addresses how isolated populations with low genetic diversity persist with focus on a subspecies of cutthroat trout: the greenback cutthroat. The greenback cutthroat, despite being Colorado\u2019s state fish, was nearly extirpated and has been reduced to a single surviving population and a handful of reintroduced populations founded from that one population. This project seeks to compare genetic diversity between greenback cutthroat and a close relative at the landscape and population levels and then link those data with the ability for recovery populations in new habitats. The project leverages a past experiment in which the two subspecies were crossed to identify genomic features that contribute to fitness and boost the genetic diversity of greenback cutthroat without swamping the genetic features that are specific to the subspecies. The project will also bring these methods into the classroom at a local minority serving college to help train students in these cutting-edge technologies.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to link the genetic basis of phenotypic traits to their interaction with the environment for a genetically depauperate and isolated fish. This research will provide a predictive framework in which genomic features identified with whole-genome sequencing at three ecological and demographic scales are linked to individual fitness. First, it will assess standing genetic variation in two subspecies, the greenback and the closely related Colorado River cutthroat trout, and identify loci correlated with key environmental features using genetic-environmental analyses. It will then focus on recently reintroduced populations to measure how genetic diversity at introduction predicts the populations persistence via phenotypic plasticity or rapid adaptation. Lastly, genomic data from the two subspecies and their hybrids will be used to identify loci associated with inbreeding load and negative fitness in greenback cutthroat. These data will inform how genetic variation and environmental attributes manifest as individual fitness and the relative ability of each subspecies to adapt to changing conditions as a function of genetic diversity. Finally, the Fellow will lead both field and bench modules at a local, minority serving institution with the goal of introducing skills beneficial to career development and in pursuit of advanced degrees in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  The goal of this project was to assess the potential for genetic rescue (the introduction of outside genetic diversity to increase population growth) of greenback cutthroat troutColorados state fish. Greenback cutthroat trout have been extirpated throughout their range and only remained as a single population in a creek outside of their historical, native range. As a result, significant efforts have been made by state and federal management agencies to recover these fish, however they remain severely inbred.   This project sampled numerous recently reintroduced greenback cutthroat sites with the goal of understanding both how much genetic diversity is available to these fish and how it promotes (or how its deficiency may hinder) their potential to adapt to new and changing habitats. It also leverages a paired sampling design with a closely related and more genetically diverse subspecies, Colorado River cutthroat trout, to understand how greenback cutthroat compare in their ability to adapt.   The main analyses in this project focus on whole-genome sequencing to understand which genes may contribute to adaptation and/or which genes may be affected by inbreeding such that deleterious recessive alleles become fixed and result in inbreeding deficiencies. In this sense, greenback cutthroat risk genetic deformities much the same as domesticated animals or the inbred family lines of historic monarchies. The research outcomes of this project will help inform targeted management of greenback cutthroat, establish genomic resources for continued monitoring and management actions as reintroduction and conservation efforts continue, and serve as a model for other, severely inbred species.   Another goal of this project was a knowledge transfer to underrepresented individuals in the fields of evolutionary biology, wildlife and fisheries management, and conservation sciences. To accomplish this, I taught a techniques module at Fort Lewis Collegea majority minority serving institution. This institution was important because it has one of the largest indigenous student populations in the country. In that vein, tribes are often comanagers of natural resources either on reservations or via treaty rights, so having tribal members with technical training for those responsibilities is important for tribal autonomy. My small role in this was to help fill in curricular gaps in their Aquatic Sampling Techniques course via a teaching module. I also used this as an opportunity to a lead a professional development discussion, in which I talked to students about professional or graduate career paths in fish and wildlife management. After the module, many students expressed that this was new information to them and they were very appreciative to receive it. I also stressed to students that they could continue to use me as a resource moving forward in their career paths. I hope to continue to engage in similar mentorship opportunities in the future.   Finally, I ended my tenure in this project approximately a quarter of the way through its intended duration. My early departure was because I transitioned to a permanent research position with the US Forest Service, for which this project served as a steppingstone. As a research fish biologist, I will continue to research questions regarding the conservation of greenback cutthroat and other cold-water fishes.

        "projectOutComesReport": "  This workshop gathered about 50 students, faculty members and developers who discussed the future of the engineering mechanics curriculum and the use of modern technology to increase education accessibility and promote customized learning experiences. First, participants prepared posters in small groups to present innovative engineering mechanics education ideas and list potential implementation challenges. Second, participants reflected on the use of diagrams to convey the concept of equilibrium and engaged in the design of a problem-based lecture on geothermal energy. Third, participants were introduced to augmented reality and virtual reality software that can be used to teach soil mechanics, physics and structural mechanics. A lecture was also delivered on the development of adaptive textbooks. Lastly, a panel discussed the creation of a web-based platform where instructors could archive education material, and where students, professors and professionals could receive support on mechanics contents, laboratory activities, lecture plans or problem sets.   The main priorities for engineering mechanics education as identified by workshop participants are to meet individual learning needs, address grand challenges of today's society, and improve education accessibility. Methods proposed to achieve these goals include active learning, interactive electronic textbooks, visualization tools, problem sets focused on the mitigation of climate change, and the development of a collaborative education platform. Anticipated technical challenges to the creation of an engineering mechanics web platform include organization of content, the development of efficient searching programs, copyright issues, peer-review of material posted, and quality moderator feedback.   This workshop created a forum to discuss the very definition of applied mechanics in the engineering curriculum. Workshop participants were engaged in a reflection on the use of computer science, data analysis and online instruction tools for enhanced learning outcomes. Participants were prompted to imagine a customized learning experience for each student. The workshop consolidated a community of scholars who will co-develop, test and peer-review revolutionary and open access education tools in engineering mechanics to address major societal challenges, mainly: climate change, energy production and storage, internet access, and economic disparities. The workshop activities highlighted various career path opportunities in engineering mechanics education, which will equip not only the workshop participants, but also their colleagues, to apply for meaningful education positions or train mentees to prepare for such positions.

The supporting hardware and software will become even more heterogeneous, employing multiple concurrency models, different numerical schemes, different number representations, and a variety of accelerators including GPUs, Tensor Cores and Matrix Accelerators that differ from each other in subtle ways. At this pace and scale, errors can occur at all levels---while developing new applications and porting existing ones---risking dissemination of incorrect results, release of flawed products and ultimately slowing down scientific findings and discoveries.\"   Participants at the workshop enumerated the many different facets of the correctness challenge in scientific computing, and considered various research directions for overcoming these challenges.

CSC was conceived by DOE and NSF to address the growing concerns about correctness among those who employ computational methods to perform large-scale scientific simulations. HPC systems are beginning to include data-driven methods, including machine learning and surrogate models, and their impact on overall HPC system correctness was also felt urgent to discuss. If correctness is not proactively addressed, there is the risk of producing flawed science on top of unacceptable productivity losses faced by computational scientists and engineers.   Stakeholders of correctness were identified to belong to several sub-disciplines of computer science; from computer architecture researchers who design special-purpose hardware that offers high energy efficiencies; numerical algorithm designers who develop efficient computational schemes based on reduced data movement; all the way to researchers in programming language and formal methods who seek methodologies for correct compilation and verification. To include attendees with such a diverse set of backgrounds, CSC was held during the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) 2023. The program of CSC consisted of keynote talks, lightning talks, and breakout sessions.

By replacing the most wasteful and costly step in the semiconductor manufacturing process, the proposed research will use sound (acoustic) energy to precisely cut semiconductor materials in a way that minimizes waste and enables materials reuse. This technology will dramatically decrease manufacturing costs and, as a result, lead to the accelerated development of faster, smaller, and more efficient devices. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a new approach to lower the cost of advanced semiconductor manufacturing by using sound energy to lift off thin devices from their host substrates. The innovative approach taken in this project uses a technique to propagate a crack front at a precise depth below the device layer of a wafer with the application of acoustic pulses. This acoustic method wastes no material and, most importantly, makes it possible to reuse the substrate, which is currently wasted using standard approaches such as mechanical back grinding. As the single largest cost in manufacturing next-generation devices based on gallium nitride, the substrate material plays a key role in achieving higher performance and efficiencies compared to silicon devices. Making more efficient use of this material directly addresses a pressing need to find solutions that drive down manufacturing costs and accelerates the adoption of new semiconductor innovations ranging from power electronics to communications devices and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In doing so, we made exciting progress towards making advanced semiconductors more affordable and made substantial headway toward cleaning up one of the most wasteful semiconductor manufacturing steps. Our work focused on using a new technology we developed called Sonic Lift-Off (SLO) to split wafers with no material loss, so that precious wafer material can be recycled or reused. Sonic Lift-off uses sound energy to achieve this task and is under development at Crystal Sonic across a variety of semiconductor materials.      We had two main technical achievements during the project. First, and most significantly, we successfully demonstrated feasibility of splitting 2 diameter high quality Gallium Nitride (GaN) wafers using our acoustically driven SLO technique. Second, we modeled and designed a key element of our Sonic Lift-off tool, that will allow us to further upscale the process in the future.      Why it matters:   Next generation semiconductors are vastly more expensive to produce than traditional Silicon-based chips. However, due to their efficiency and performance advantages, they remain essential for our future sustainability and electrification goals. For perspective, the move to materials such as SiC and GaN in power electronics has been estimated by the industry to have the potential to save 6 gigatons of CO2 annually by 2050. The wafer materials used for these next generation semiconductors undergo several wasteful processing steps during manufacturing, which we can replace with a reusability step, enabled by Sonic Lift-off technology. By integrating this technology into future semiconductor manufacturing, we will be able to accelerate the adoption of advanced semiconductor materials that are essential for our future energy and communications infrastructure.   This phase I project allowed us to establish critical initial feasibility results that have been well received by commercial device manufacturers and materials suppliers. As a result, this has put us firmly on the path toward successful commercialization.        Last Modified: 04/28/2024       Submitted by: ArnoMerkle",

Similarly, the reliability and dependability of systems that make data-driven decisions through large-scale machine learning (ML) must also be ensured, as these systems not only control day-to-day aspects of human life but also interact with HPC systems in significant ways to reduce and/or accelerate simulation.   Stakeholders in correctness in this space belong to several sub-disciplines of computer science: computer architecture researchers who design special-purpose hardware that offers high energy efficiencies; numerical algorithm designers who develop efficient computational schemes based on reduced precision as well as reduced data movement; and researchers in programming language and formal methods who seek methodologies for correct compilation and verification. We must pursue formal and informal correctness, resilience, reproducibility, trustworthiness and explainability of results.   Given the above, the goal of this project was to organize a workshop, DOE/NSF Workshop on Correctness in Scientific Computing, to provide the opportunity for such diverse group of stakeholders to meet and discuss important issues related to correctness of scientific computing.

        "abstractText": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase post-secondary student success via academic and career guidance. A large body of research on career navigation has studied how post-secondary education, career readiness (understanding viable career paths at graduation), and its interconnectedness are important for a growing number of first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students. With increasing undergraduate degree program offerings in response to an evolving future of work and student-to-counselor ratios of 1: 1,800 in public colleges, career guidance, and academic navigation risk being unavailable. As a result, during the pandemic, Institutes of Higher Education (IHEs) that serve students of color and students from low-income backgrounds saw declines in enrollment that far outpaced their predominantly White peer institutions. The proposed platform intends to increase the visibility, accessibility, and discoverability of competencies to potential career and academic paths for students at IHEs. The platform envisions doing this via near-peer role models who are similar in their dimensions of self-efficacy. With more than 85 million jobs that could go unfilled by 2030, the proposed platform may help alleviate part of that shortage by widening the talent aperture.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is in the company\u2019s patented technology of a unified, multi-dimensional, data representation model that creates a \u2018competency fingerprint\u2019 for each user. The data representation method enables better machine learning models to \u2018infer\u2019 competency from unstructured data of a student\u2019s traditional and non-traditional learning experience, rather than degrees, majors, grade point averages (GPAs), or test scores. The platform uses a consistent, scalable, competency nomenclature for hard and soft skills gained via traditional academic and outside-of-the-classroom experiences to discover academic-career paths where the students\u2019 learning competencies may be in demand. There is a significant technical challenge in adopting this technology for the inter/cross-disciplinary jobs of the future:  such a platform requires a robust, larger data set to evaluate the relevance of matching, in a discipline-agnostic context. Reduction of this variability is the key technical risk to be overcome by the proposed research and development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "      Successful careers are built on Skills (what you know), Occupational Identity (what you believe you can be), and Social Capital (who you know). Educational institutions spend significant resources in addressing the first, sometimes to the exclusion of the other two  which are difficult and expensive to teach and administer. Using AI-enabled \"competency fingerprints\", Epixego Inc. (Epixego) is developing a mentoring and career discovery technology to integrate all three  a mentoring and career discovery system based on self-reflection of users in classroom and out-of-class experiences. This technology leverages near-peers as mentors, scaling mentoring instruction to hundreds of students and simplifying the oversight of a mentoring program required by a single faculty member.   Epixegos technology was first successfully demonstrated in research conducted by the University of California to study the efficacy of near-peer mentoring intervention amongst undergraduate and graduate STEM students across three campuses. Results showed a 23% increase in student social capital and occupational identity, encouraging developers to expand and test the platform in a disciplinary-agnostic environment. In 2023, Epixego embarked on an NSF SBIR Phase I program with the primary project objective to test the applicability of the patented competency fingerprint technology in the administration of mentoring and internship programs in a wider array of subjects and Institutes of Higher Education.   With over 10 pilots in the Summer and Fall of 2023, Epixego collaborated with faculty members teaching innovation/entrepreneurship-related courses in business and performing arts in 2 and 4-year colleges. Epixego worked closely with the faculty to develop and embed a near-peerneer-peer mentoring curriculum to create high-impact courses, with minimized instructional/administrative burden. The faculty members were eager to incorporate the supplemental mentoring curriculum into their course instruction to teach how students might think of mentoring and access to social capital, using design-thinking principles. The facultys course impact was measured through student self-efficacy, occupational identity, and social capital measures, as adapted from Social Cognitive Career Theory and Social Capital Theory. For experiential learning (internships), Epixego embedded the technology with Lehigh Universitys Entrepreneurial Internship program over the Summer of 2023.   The results of the SBIR Phase I pilots were a remarkable success. After a short training session, faculty members administered the mentoring program as an integrated part of their course curriculum. Students expanded their knowledge of connecting what they know'' with who they know as measured by learning competencies [increased skills and competency measures], near-peer role models to expand occupational identities [increased occupational identity measures], and examples of successful mentor-mentee relationship to building their social capital [increased social capital measures]. When student participants used a language of competencies to reflect on their learning journey, their choice of internship preferences changed by 40%.   Two key challenges faced during the pilot were (a) accommodating mentoring in asynchronous courses, where students engage with course materials at their own pace, and (b) scaling and training other faculty. Several courses at 2-year colleges continued with asynchronous formats post-COVID. This meant that faculty would never interact with their students in a live setting. The challenge with internship matching was working with Institutions unique requirements to classify/categorize internships to meet institutional goals while balancing student discovery without classifications.   Epixego successfully adapted the mentoring curriculum, with faculty guidance, to an asynchronous format. This flexibility ensured all students could benefit from the mentoring program, regardless of instructional format. Students appreciated the program for peer interactions in asynchronous courses. Epixego additionally adapted its technology to allow variations in institutional language of internship categories, while retaining the core aspects of competency-based student discovery.   The success and enthusiasm of the faculty allowed Epixego to tackle the second challenge encountered with the mentoring program. Epixego was able to channel facultys enthusiasm to share and train other faculty and/or alumni to offer mentoring curriculum as part of their course instructional curriculum. Faculty trained alumni who were brought in as guest speakers in the context of their course. The guest speakers facilitated teaching how to build social capital and participated in the mentoring program over 5-weeks.   In Phase II, Epixego plans to make the mentoring curriculum and technology easier to embed in instruction and expand into 50 California Community Colleges with faculty teaching entrepreneurship-related courses. The focus will be on designing a modular mentoring curriculum that is flexible, easy to implement, measure, and scale along with internship programs. Additionally, Epixego will enhance the technology platform by integrating conversational AI to guide/support mentoring conversations, creating hooks for seamless data transfer to learning management systems, and providing real-time analytics for faculty to track student learning and progress.   Partnering with faculty and institutions allows Epixego to transform instruction into high-impact practice. Faculty have embraced mentoring curriculum and technology, recognizing its potential to enhance course effectiveness and student engagement. This collaborative approach can create a more effective, inclusive, supportive, and scalable learning environment for all students.

This doctoral dissertation project analyses universalist accounts of cattle-led environmental degradation by highlighting how different actors\u2013scientific experts and lay breeders, dairy farmers and milk traders, colonial bureaucrats and postcolonial politicians - conceptualized and connected dairy development with economic and political projects in colonial and post-colonial contexts between 1880-1970. These years constituted the peak of the British colonial military\u2019s experiments with organizing the milk supply, and they also mark the beginning of the world\u2019s largest dairy development program. By investigating knowledge production about cattle, fodder, and milk, this project asks three broad questions: 1) what values, politics and concerns drove scientific experiments and public anxiety with purity, productivity, and the health of milk and the livestock 2) what role did the politics of race and caste play in the material organization of dairy infrastructures? and finally, 3) how did dairy development projects affect the cattle, cattle herders and pastoralists, and urban and rural environments?<br/><br/>This project applies historical and qualitative methods to archival material. Sources include popular and scientific journals and outlets that focused on animal husbandry, dairying, and agriculture as well as archival sources that focus on policies related to dairying and dairy development in the twentieth century. By foregrounding knowledge production about milk and cattle as a highly contested political and social process, this project connects critical scholarship on science and technology with histories of food, environment, caste, and race.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

At NAI, records of the following departments were examined to understand the origins of states investment in developing the dairy industry: military department, education health and lands department, civil veterinary department, and the records of the director-general of Indian medical services. At NMML, research focused on two types of collections: a) personal papers and correspondence of key figures and institutions involved with cattle protectionist efforts, and b) institutional and personal papers related to dairy development projects undertaken in postcolonial planning schemes. In addition to state archives, published popular materials on cattle and dairy issues were gathered from the Marwari Library in Delhi, the Nagari Pracharini Sabha library in Banaras, and several local libraries in the city of Kanpur. Support from NSF also made possible initial archival trips to key institutions and archives in Western India: this includes the national dairy development board library in Anand, Indian Institute of Managements archives in Ahmedabad, the Maharashtra State Archive and Film Division of Indias archive in Bombay and the Tata Archive in Pune.   Initial research from this project was presented at two conferences in the US in Fall 2023. Findings from this research were also quoted in a Washington Post article on the rapid growth of milk consumption in postcolonial India. Research undertaken under this award will contribute to completion of a doctoral dissertation that will be defended in 2025, preparation of academic journal articles, and a public facing visual project on the politics of dairy in modern India.

This cash crop, which is used in everything from tires to telegraph cables, fundamentally changed the world. The project combines archival and ethnographic research in order to answer the following research questions: What articulations of racial and environmental justice emerge from people\u2019s different modes of relation to Hevea Brasiliensis from colonialism until present day? What socio-environmental considerations underpin colonial and postcolonial science? How are postcolonial power hierarchies, such as indigeneity, citizenship and class, re-negotiated through the cultivation of rubber by different social groups? <br/><br/>Undertaking a qualitative analysis, this study explores the ways in which colonial officials, smallholders, biotechnology scientists, indigenous communities and artists in colonial and postcolonial contexts have cultivated Hevea Brasiliensis in different ways and with different socio-environmental implications. The project critically analyses how cultivating rubber through science, ancestral knowledge and aesthetics can enable the articulation of multiple forms of social and environmental justice from within monocrop plantations. Moreover, given the growing challenges posed by the interdependencies between climate variability and industrial agriculture, it also speaks to questions of environmental sustainability and social justice. Findings from this project will provide insights and recommendations for governmental and nongovernmental actors interested in aspects of environmental and social sustainability in the context of industrial agriculture. Also, findings will benefit scholars and the public through the dissemination of publications and pedagogical materials through free-of-charge online platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "     During the tenure of the DDRIG, I undertook 11 months of ethnographic field research with scientists, artists and Indigenous communities and 1 month of archival research in Malaysia. Specifically, I attended training workshops, shadowed laboratory work and interviewed scientists at the Malaysian Rubber Board and the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia; I apprenticed with artists from the Malaysian Artist Intention Experiment (MAIX), undertook exploratory forest expeditions and interviewed artists, Indigenous collaborators and curators; and I followed Indigenous communities tapping in and attending to their rubber gardens. My research project investigated how my interlocutors engage differently with the rubber tree, a colonial transplant to British Malaya, and the various socio-environmental justice agendas they engender. As I investigated the ways in which my interlocutors animated the rubber tree as a forest tree in different waysI expand on this below, I explored the extent to which colonial extraction in relation to forests and plantations remains relevant. The notion of excision, which I encountered in the archives, enabled me to trace the ways in which colonial extraction within plantation worlds continues to manifest today. With colonial excisions marking clear boundaries between forests as government timber plantations and between forests and rubber plantation, my project worked with my interlocutors differential animation of rubber as a forest tree to investigate how postcolonial excisions reproduce, subvert or rework colonial logics of racialized extraction. Specifically, while rubber enabled scientists to empower Malays at the expense of Indigenous communities, thus furthering racialized agendas of colonial extraction, it also contributed to the empowerment of Indigenous communities through networks of kinship.     This conceptual shift strengthens the intellectual merits and broader impact of the project. From an intellectual standpoint, the project situates postcolonial forestry research as a critical site for negotiation between Western scientific norms and postcolonial ethics. In exploring how the scientists reimagined the rubber tree from a latex-only cash crop to a viable timber species by integrating Western advisory services and local requirements for timber crowns, boles and volumes, the project shows how postcolonial science can destabilize and rework Western scientific authority. Furthermore, by examining the ongoing lives of colonial logics of extraction in a postcolonial setting, the project bridges STS and history of science not just in one area, namely cash crop plantation development, but across two parallel yet interconnected extraction sites, namely forests and cash crop plantations. In this sense, my project enables me to trace more clearly how the interdependencies between science, colonialism and extraction across different sites converge and diverge in postcolonial settings. Finally, by exploring how Indigenous communities and artists animate rubber as kin, albeit in different ways, this project adds an Indigenous and Critical Race Theory lens to STS inquiries of the relations between human and colonial transplanted nonhumans. As I focus on the differential animacies of rubber as a forest kin and the ways in which rubber helps resituate relations of Indigeneity, my project simultaneously unsettles the certainties of colonial extraction across cash crop plantations while offering alternative meanings of forests grounded in kinship with material and immaterial others.     Due to relations developed in the field and based on archival research undertaken, my project will have a broader impact in unanticipated ways. The focus on forest excision and colonial extraction across forests and cash crop plantations enabled me to forge strong collaborative relations with Indigenous communities across Malaysia. In particular, findings from my project will be used by scholars and activists to support Indigenous claims to land in Malaysia across both forested and deforested areas. In addition to collaborating with Indigenous communities, my project also benefits the scientific communities with whom I have worked. I have been invited to share my findings in scientific forums, both in Malaysia and abroad, and have discussed policy implications of my research, such as carbon credits and socio-environmental sustainability norms in the rubber industry, with both governmental and non governmental actors from Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority, the International Rubber Research and Development Board, Rimba Watch, Macaranga and Forest Peoples Programme.

        "abstractText": "Movement is an essential characteristic of living organisms that affects ecological and evolutionary dynamics from the scale of single individuals to entire ecosystems. As such, Movement Ecology has emerged as a dynamic, new field of research dedicated to understanding the different forms of animal movement, its ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences across taxonomic groups, and its implications for conservation and management. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Movement Ecology of Animals is the only international forum for researchers in this burgeoning field of research. The GRC format focuses on the presentation of cutting-edge, unpublished research in a stimulating and cooperative environment, aiming to promote dialogue and facilitate networking among scientists at all career stages. Funding from the NSF will help broaden participation at the 2023 GRC on the Movement Ecology of Animals by directly supporting the attendance of early career researchers, members of historically underrepresented groups, and those serving in undergraduate or minority-serving institutions. <br/>The 2023 GRC on the Movement Ecology of Animals is entitled \u201cProximate and Ultimate Drivers of Animal Movement\u201d. Following this theme, invited presentations will define the different ecological and evolutionary drivers of animal movement and consider its diverse consequences for individuals, populations, and communities. This theme is particularly timely given the current rate of rapid global change and society\u2019s reflections on how we can, and should, respond to it. The GRC will also be held in conjunction with a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) focused on the theme \u201cTheory and Hypothesis-Testing in the Movement Ecology\u201d. The GRS is a 2-day meeting preceding the conference organized for and by Early-Career Researchers (ECRs) to present new, unpublished research and discuss cutting-edge ideas amongst peers in a welcoming and stimulating environment. NSF funding will enable us to achieve three major goals of the joint meetings: 1) broaden participation of diverse groups (in terms of race, gender, career stage, and institution), 2) expand mentorship opportunities for ECRs, and 3) develop new professional relationships to synthesize and stimulate research emerging from the meeting to the broader scientific community. As such, this NSF award will enhance the scientific and professional development of a more diverse group of researchers who would otherwise most likely not be able to attend.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": " The Movement Ecology of Animals GRC was a premier, international scientific conference focused on advancing the frontiers of science through the presentation of cutting-edge and unpublished research, prioritizing time for discussion after each talk and fostering informal interactions among scientists of all career stages. The conference program included a diverse range of speakers and discussion leaders from institutions and organizations worldwide, concentrating on the latest developments in the field. The conference was five days long and held in a remote location to increase the sense of camaraderie and create scientific communities, with lasting collaborations and friendships. In addition to premier talks, the conference had designated time for poster sessions from individuals of all career stages, and afternoon free time and communal meals allowed for informal networking opportunities with leaders in the field.  Research in the young and exciting scientific field of \"Movement Ecology\" has already led to major insights in our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes, from ecosystem function, to individual and social behaviours, population dynamics, community ecology and conservation. Technological advances in animal biologging, paralleled by data storage and sharing initiatives, have opened the \"big data\" era for animal movement. In parallel, a myriad of analytical tools and code packages are being developed to process these large datasets to address broad-scale and overarching questions in ecology, evolution, and behaviour. However, to keep on par with these methodological advances, we now need to solidify the theoretical basis of movement to better understand the causes of animal movement, and its consequences at different spatio-temporal scales. What are the proximate and ultimate drivers of movement, how do these drivers function and can we make some general rules that apply across living organisms ? This Gordon conference addressed these aspects of movement ecology by focusing on the evolution of movement and dispersal and the processes that shape these traits. It also explicitly examined the ecological and evolutionary consequences of movement - from individual fitness to community dynamics, from disease epidemiology to conservation - in order to link our fundamental advances to current applied questions related to the dynamics of animal populations in a rapidly changing world and to the challenging future scenarios that lie ahead.  Building off past meetings, the planned sessions for the 2023 conference fell into three main themes: the evolution of animal movement - including its fundamental basis and underlying variability -, the proximate processes that define movement decisions, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of movement, with explicit consideration of the general patterns that emerge across systems and how these patterns match on-going and future changes in natural systems.

Only 3% of BLV individuals have been employed in a STEM field. The lack of accessible accommodations creates roadblocks for these students in STEM education throughout their academic journey, leading many students to give up, even though they have as much potential for academic success as the general population. All web-based, non-decorative diagrams are required to include alternative (alt) text descriptions for use with screen readers. Current methods for making STEM visualizations accessible through alt text are not scalable or amenable for use with dynamic digital media, nor is alt text standardized or proven usable by learners, resulting in lost learning opportunities for BLV students. The absence of reliable auto alt text generation is a roadblock for educational institutions and academic publishers to adopt new instructional technologies, as digital content and learning systems must include accommodations for accessibility. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will create a first-of-its kind system that generates descriptions of STEM diagrams as the educational resources are constructed. This project will go beyond current standards for accommodation, by creating an innovative layered approach to the alt text representation of STEM diagrams so that screen reader users can interact with the content in a manner that is best supported by their skills and prior knowledge. The technical objectives are to: 1) create a system that produces machine-readable configurations for the components of a diagram and spatial relationships between the components, and then generates a text-based description of the diagram and 2) devise a non-linear method for representing STEM content through a standardized system of representational layers within the description. Both the general description (objective 1) and layered description (objective 2) will be constructed by matching the diagram configuration to a context-driven lexicon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  This NSF Phase I project was proposed to solve the problem of the inaccessibility of diagrams and interactives for STEM instruction, due to the lack of standardized and useful alternative (alt) text. Alt text are descriptions in a the meta-data of an image that are read by a screen reader so that visual content is accessible. Screen reader users (SRUs) are typically those who are blind or have low vision (BLV), but screen readers are also helpful for others, such as non-native speakers and neurodiverse individuals, such as those with dyslexia.   In higher education, and increasingly K-12 education, the problem of creating real-time descriptions of diagrams presents a major technical and market challenge to companies providing modern, exploratory, and visually rich learning methods to the general population of students.   This project demonstrated that STEM interactives and static diagrams can be made accessible by developing a method to produce alt text descriptions as diagrams are constructed. The technical developments can be divided into three interconnected components, all parts of the description system.   1) Auto-generated alt text descriptions   2) A keyboard accessible control panel (KACP) for interactives   3) A digital assistant that can act as a tutor or provide extended descriptions   The auto-generated alt text is the backbone for the other two components. Application of the alt text descriptions to the other components expanded the inventions importance and, for the first time, created a use case where all users could benefit from the inclusion of alt text.   The auto-generated alt text system creates an organized method for categorizing the elements and relationships within the visual field of the interactive, attached context, and generated language to match the visuals. The team used three existing chemistry-based interactives (VSEPR for molecular geometry exploration, Lewis Structures for molecular construction, and an organic chemistry drawing tool) and designed the description system iteratively with the assistance of a blind consultant who checked the usability of the descriptions. To demonstrate reproducibility of the method, the auto-generated alt text component was also developed for two non-chemistry interactives: one for early math and one for physics.   Alt text descriptions are not enough to create an interactive that is usable by a SRU. Part of the project was to create an interface that would be an alternative to the mouse or touch screen that is used by sighted users. Currently many digital applications use keyboard controls to replace actions performed by a mouse for embedded accessibility. There is tremendous cognitive load for a SRU to understand the elements, their relationships, and spatial arrangement within a diagram, and adding the need to memorize keyboard controls made this method nearly impossible to use. Design focus shifted to the KACP with a series of choices in a menu of interactions and controls to manipulate the interactive. This interaction model also aligned well with the organization of how the alt text descriptions were constructed.   SRUs also interact differently with alt text descriptions. Some need more repetition; others need more context. We wanted to provide an interactive method for a SRU to query the description to help build the mental representation of the visual. The interactive alt text system was created by integrating with a large language model, to build an AI-driven query system.   This AI-driven interface could assist the SRU in understanding the visual of the diagram through questions and answers delivered through the screen reader. We demonstrated that AI system could be used as an interface tutorial to assist students, both sighted and visually impaired, in learning how to use the interactive. We also added a rubric to the knowledge base that followed a specific learning objectives to build a pedagogical pathway for the AI system, to give targeted guidance as needed, and thus created a learning assistant for everyone.   A research study with over 300 sighted students using the Lewis Structure interactive confirmed the auto-generated alt text description provided clear information for constructing the chemical diagram. Over 80% of the 3000 diagrams constructed in this part of the research study were correctly done.   A three-part research study with four blind individuals tested the alt text description component, the use of the AI system for querying the description, and the usability of the KACP. The research subjects all used their own computers with their preferred screen readers, and all of them praised the usefulness of the descriptions, the intuitiveness of the interface, and the ability to ask the system for more details through the AI-interface.

The importance of a forum such as ASPLOS continues to grow as we grapple with the end of Dennard scaling, the explosion of big data, scales ranging from ultra-low power wearable devices to exascale parallel and cloud computers, the need for sustainability, and increasingly human-centered applications. ASPLOS embraces systems research that directly targets new problems in innovative ways. The research may target diverse goals: performance, energy, thermal efficiency, resiliency, security, sustainability, and applicability to future technologies, applications, and environments. The ASPLOS travel grant was successful in supporting students to attend the conference. The travel grants were funded by multiple sources, including NSF and ACM SIGs.In total 70 students were supported to travel to the conference, with the NSF supporting 25 students.   Participation in ASPLOS 2023 is valuable as it provides students with the opportunity to attend paper presentations, engage in discussions with senior researchers and other students. The support enabled students to attend the conference including many students that would be unable to attend otherwise.   Many students presented their research at the conference with the full list available at the asplos website:https://asplos-conference.org/2023   We really appreciate the National Science Foundation for this support.

        "abstractText": "Next-next generation interfaces and the technologies that will drive them provide new challenges to accessibility, as well as new tools for addressing these barriers. These new technologies can also help us address barriers that some people face with today\u2019s technologies \u2013 barriers that we currently do not have good solutions for. This is particularly true for cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, deaf-blindness, blindness and intellectual impairments and other combinations of disabilities. Despite successes, it has become apparent that this work needs a new paradigm. Thus, this workshop aims to gather and engage mainstream and disability leaders and innovators in their fields to: a) Thoroughly explore all visions for the future of the interface; b) Gather all different thoughts, approaches, and paradigms from the best in the international accessibility community; and c) Create both mainstream and accessibility research agendas that can result in solutions for next-next generation interface technologies, to be available when these technologies enter the marketplace instead of five years or more behind them. As a byproduct of the workshop, a special website will be created, capturing all of the presentations, preparatory materials, and the final research agenda.  The impact on society of more accessible product interfaces cannot be easily measured, but with the new estimates of a fifth to a quarter of the population having disabilities, and the increasing reliance on digital interfaces in everything we do, even in developing countries, the impact of more accessible interfaces will be quite significant, both to economies and to quality of life for large sectors of the population.<br/><br/>This workshop will bring together leaders in mainstream human computer interaction and supporting technologies to help predict the future interface, as well as the best minds in accessibility to help imagine new approaches and methods to address these technologies.  The result of just these two activities would be of great value to the field. The creation of both a mainstream technology and an accessibility research agenda will be of even more immediate and long-term use to academic researchers and students, and to developers in companies interested in practical ways to make their future product interfaces accessible. It will also be useful to consumer groups, funding agencies, policy makers, assistive technology developers, and independent researchers and developers in shaping their future work, agendas, and goals. The resulting research agenda is intended to be a living agenda that is updated over time and used by the broad range of stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Workshop and follow-up activities to create an international research agenda for next-next generation interfaces.      In February 2023, a two-day virtual workshop was held to explore how emerging technologies could be used to make information and communication technologies (ICT) more accessible to people with disabilities and the aging population. Despite decades of effort by consumers, industry, and the courts, only about 5% of all products are currently accessible, and even these are not accessible to many people with disabilities. Almost no products fully meet the existing minimum accessibility guidelines.   The workshop, co-hosted by Vinton Cerf and Gregg Vanderheiden, gathered top researchers in mainstream and disability research to discuss these issues. Over 1500 people internationally registered for the workshop, which was organized as a series of nine panels. On the first day, mainstream experts provided an assessment of the state-of-the-art and predictions for: future interfaces, AI and intelligent interfaces, XR/AR/VR, direct brain interfaces, and machine/computer vision. All panels were open to questions from the international attendees. At the end of the day, an open roundtable was held to capture any topics or aspects not covered in the panels.   On the second day, disability experts, researchers, and consumers discussed the previous days presentations and their implications and applications toward making current and future technology accessible. The panels focused on direct brain interfaces, XR/AR/VR and virtual worlds, access by people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, and finally alternate approaches to accessibility that might be enabled by new technologies. The day ended with a work session on creating a research agenda to try to both prevent emerging technologies from creating new access barriers and importantly, to use the new technologies to solve accessibility problems we have not been able to address to date.   The primary conclusions from the workshop and pre and post discussions included the following points:  AI and intelligent agents will move from just being assistants to being mediators or interfaces themselves to information, other people, objects, and systems in our environment. This will not occur without controversy, but is inevitable. Direct Brain interfaces will move from research to semi-common practice over the next decade. They will include less invasive means and will provide a means for direct interface with things in our environment, first for people with disabilities and then for people more generally. XR/VR/AR adoption will be slowed for a while until it can be miniaturized to be less cumbersome. In the meantime, it will find medical, industrial, and disability applications. Once more convenient and aesthetic it will take off and could change the way we think about ourselves, our environment, and our interactions with others. Computer vision will advance from object identification to understanding of objects and their role and function  allowing a whole new level of understanding and interaction between a) computers and the environment and b) computers understanding the interfaces on products.    With regard to implications for people with disabilities, the primary conclusion included:  Direct Brain interfaces (both invasive and non-invasive) are already providing interfaces and control to people with disabilities  and this will only increase in type and quality. XR/VR/AR, on the other hand, are seen as both a potential aid to people with disabilities and a potential new barrier to people with disabilities if and as they are adopted for mainstream use since strategies to provide full access to all people with disabilities do not yet exist. The introduction of AI and Generative AI holds promise for the development of assistive technologies for people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities that have not been possible before. The emerging technologies together provide the opportunity to approach accessibility in a majorly different way  that can overcome the barriers that have prevented us from both a) making more than a very small portion of products accessible, and b) making products accessible to people with the full range of types, degrees, and combinations of disability.    The workshop ended with a session open to all participants to gather topics and areas to address in building a research agenda to realize the above potentials and address identified concerns.A preliminary version is provided in the final report.Review, contribution, and extension are continuing.   By bringing together mainstream and disability experts, this joint NSF/NIDILRR-ACL workshop was able to provide new insights into what is likely to be available from mainstream research, and areas where disability research will be needed both to address potential new barriers and to enable use of these emerging technologies to create new types of assistive technology that can address currently unaddressable issues.   A website was created in conjunction with the workshop. It captured the workshop presentations so that they could be viewed later and provided an Exploratorium for people interested in exploring the history and future visions of mainstream and accessible interfaces.https://futureofinterface.org.

        "abstractText": "To learn their first language, children need to learn variation in the language, as systematic variation is present at all levels of language structure and is an integral part of linguistic knowledge. To give an example in English, speakers sometimes pronounce words ending in -ing with -in\u2019 (e.g., working vs. workin\u2019) depending on language-internal factors (e.g., -in\u2019 is used more frequently in participles than in nouns like \u2018morning\u2019) as well as external (e.g., -in\u2019 is used more frequently in casual conversational context than formal). To learn such probabilistic patterns is a daunting challenge as children must figure out variants in alternation, factors relevant to the alternation, relative probabilistic rates associated with each variant and more. Accounting for this process is crucial to any account of language acquisition, yet only a handful of studies have directly investigated children\u2019s acquisition of variation. <br/><br/>While emergent evidence suggests that children do acquire variation, we also know they tend to change their language input and make it more regular \u2014 a process often referred to as regularization. Taken together, a paradox arises: children apparently learn and match probabilistic linguistic variation under some circumstances but regularize such variation under others. When would children match variation and when would they regularize? While previous research identified the presence of a conditioning factor, quantity of input and frequency of alternating context as important factors, this question remains largely under-explored. This dissertation investigates the effects of reliability of language input and whether variability is shared across speakers on learners' matching of probabilistic variation. Specifically, child learners are exposed to miniature languages designed to contain variation, and factors are manipulated one at a time to determine whether they provide learners with important cues with respect to whether to regularize or learn the variation. This research contributes to a further understanding of how children balance two important learning mechanisms to find regularity despite noisy signals while preserving meaningful probabilistic aspects of the language, thus yielding insight into cognitive mechanisms underlying language acquisition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  There is abundant and systematic variation in language.To give an example in English, speakers sometimes pronounce words ending in -ing with -in' (e.g., pronouns working as workin') depending on linguistic (e.g., more -in' in progressives like 'working' than in nouns like 'morning') and social (e.g.,more -in' in casual context than in formal one) factors. To become a native speaker, children need to learn variation in the language, as it is an integral part of linguistic knowledge. As it won't be wrong to use any variant in any context (e.g., although workin' occurs less in informal context, speakers still can and do say workin'), children are learning a probablistic dependency between the variants and these lingusitic and social factors that condition their use.Andemergent evidence suggests that children do match these probablisitc patterns in their production of variation.   On the other hand, we also know children often change their language input and make it more regular -- a process often referred to as regularization. For example, when faced with inconsistencies in language input (e.g., having multiple forms for the same meaning), children may reduce the noise by consistently using one form. We see this regularization behavior when children learn emergent sign languages, pidgins or creoles and in lab-created languages.   Taken together, a paradox arises: children apparently learn and match probabilistic linguistic variation under some circumstances but regularize such variation under others. When would children match variation and when would they regularize? While previous research identified many important factors, this question remains largely under-explored.   In this project, using artificial language learning experiments with children and adults, weshowed that learners are sensitive to sophisticated cues during this trade-off. Children regularized a conditioned plural-marking pattern more when the variants were similar (ka/ga) than when they were distinct (ka/po), while adults regularized in neither. Crucially, when ka/ga marked a salient contrast in meaning (singular/plural), children no longer regularized to the same extent. While adultsmatched the probablistic rule on variant use more accurately when it is shared by multiple speakers, we didn't find the same pattern with children.   This research suggests thatlearners use sophisticated use of a diverse cues when approaching to learn probablistic linguistic input. This contributes new insight into cognitive mechanisms underlying language acquisition.           Last Modified: 02/22/2024       Submitted by: YiranChen",

The program will benefit faculty mentors by providing them with dedicated students interested in research. The students, who will work in the labs of outstanding scientists, will learn how to think like a scientist, understand how to submit a successful application to graduate school, and succeed in a scientific career. Many of the students will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be required to register in the NSF ETAP system and will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.<br/><br/>Student research will focus on the role of organismal resilience and robustness in response to biotic and abiotic stress, emphasizing how these responses shape biological processes. Research projects range from how organisms respond to the environmental stress of climate change to how plants and animals respond to the biotic stress of pathogens The sponsoring scientists are faculty in the departments of Integrative Biology, Molecular and Cell Biology, and Plant and Microbial Biology. The students also receive training in scientific ethics and the responsible conduct of research and effective scientific communication. The program is assessed using the online SALG URSSA tool and by entry and exit surveys. Students apply to the REU using a UC Berkeley portal and provide demographic information, an unofficial transcript, two letters of reference, and a statement of purpose. Students are selected based on their enthusiasm for science and their ability to express themselves scientifically. Students from groups underrepresented in science, from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and from schools with limited research resources are encouraged to apply.

        "projectOutComesReport": "  The REU Site at UC Berkeley: How Robustness and Resilience in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stressors Shape Biological Processes had two main goals. The first was to increase the number of first-generation, financially disadvantaged, and underrepresented minority students entering careers in biology. The second was to build and educate a cadre of mentors, trained, experienced, and committed to the furtherance of diversity in the UCB bioscience community. The funding for this REU site was for the summer of 2023. We trained 11 undergraduate scholars during the summer. Students meeting our criteria were recruited from colleges and universities across the country with special efforts focused on small colleges where students have limited access to research opportunities, California State Universities (CSUs), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). We reach out to these students at the annual Society for Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) conference and the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minoritized Scientists (ABRCMS) and by direct outreach efforts with the CSUs and HBCUs.      The selected scholars spent 10 weeks in well-funded UC Berkeley labs doing cutting-edge science from the departments of Bioengineering, Environmental Science, Policy and Management, Integrative Biology, Molecular and Cell Biology, and Plant and Microbial Biology. The labs were chosen based on the scholars interests, the excellence of the science conducted by the lab, and a successful record of mentoring undergraduate students. The broad interests of the participating labs exposed the scholars to new areas of biological research that extended their knowledge of unfamiliar areas of research, and we find that many scholars became interested in biological questions outside of their focus during the course of the program.      Besides working full-time in their research labs, the scholars participated in several events that prepare them to apply to and succeed in graduate school: i) they attended weekly professional and scientific workshops that prepared the scholars to present their work orally and in writing and to prepare them to apply to graduate school; ii) they attended weekly seminars where the sponsoring faculty presented their research; iii) they presented their work orally in a symposium at the end of the ten weeks; iv) they wrote abstracts describing their research, which were placed in a booklet that was handed out at the symposium; v) groups of 4-5 scholars were assigned to a Graduate Student Assistant (GSAs), who met with them weekly to help them understand their projects and prepare their abstracts and final oral presentations. These GSAs, their faculty, and lab mentors helped them prepare posters for conference presentations, their graduate school applications, and their fellowship applications after they left the program.      A diverse group of scholars were trained during the program. Demographically, 7 of the 11 scholars were women, 3 were men and one identified as nonbinary. 10 were from minorities underrepresented in STEM, 4 were Pell grant recipients, 4 were the first in their family to attend college, and 7 were from small colleges with limited access to research. The scholars excelled during the 10-week program: 9 won travel awards to present their work at conferences, and 3 won presentation awards at the SACNAS or ABRCMS conferences.      During the last cycle, we also worked with a group of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who mentored the REU scholars. These scientists gained valuable experience that will make them better mentors for students from diverse backgrounds as they progress in their careers.

To address these challenges the team will bring together roboticists, spoken dialogue systems researchers, human-robot interaction researchers, computer scientists, speech scientists and technologists and natural language processing researchers to understand how to use various knowledge sources so that robots can more naturally and effectively interact with people. Success in this area will help a broad application of social robots to the benefit of society, including working with and alongside people in homes, schools, hospitals, and workplaces. The expected result of Dialogue and Robots workshop is the stimulation of interdisciplinary collaborations that focus on solving problems in speech communication that currently limit the effectiveness of social robots in various situations. <br/><br/>The workshop participants' discussions cover a range of problems, from the basics of the platforms to technical challenges in robotics, human-robot interaction, spoken dialogue systems, and natural language processing. Topics include processing multimodal data, situated reasoning, achieving common ground in human-AI collaboration, building trust in collaborative systems, and applications of such systems for social good.

        "projectOutComesReport": "  The Dialogue with Robots workshop convened at the University of Pittsburgh on April 7th and 8th, 2023. Over 25 researchers from across the United States participated in person, with some others participating remotely. Participants represented researchers in robotics, human-robot interaction, natural language processing, and spoken dialogue systems. The workshop allowed researchers to discuss, network, plan, and also allowed some local graduate students to participate in the discussions.   Day 1 of the workshop began with a welcome, then a keynote by Yonathan Bisk (CMU). During the day, there were 3 discussion sessions where participants broke out into interest groups to talk about specific topics and report on the discussions. All notes and materials were shared with all participants. Day 1 concluded with a working dinner, carrying on many of the discussions.   Day 2 began with a keynote from Stefanie Tellex (Brown University). We then discussed the summary of recommendations for NSF and began a draft of the list of project white papers.   The goal of the workshop was to produce three white papers to guide future research. The three broad topics were: educating students, benchmarks, and research on robots using large language models. All participants helped author the white papers. The white papers have been published as a single article on arXiv.        Last Modified: 06/07/2024       Submitted by: CaseyRKennington",

        "abstractText": "This interdisciplinary project integrates geochemistry, ecology, and archaeology to understand what drove the transition from the Middle Stone Age (MSA) to the Later Stone Age (LSA). This technological transition, which occurred around 50,000 years ago, is one of the most prominent behavioral changes observed in human evolutionary history. Possible environmental drivers of the MSA-LSA transition have been proposed, but establishing robust links between environmental and behavioral change has been challenging due to the lack of appropriate datasets. This project will quantify the degree of precipitation seasonality, dietary seasonality, and large animal movement through this key period while fostering research links and providing a foundation for undergraduate training in a collaborative environment. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the project would enhance public understanding of science and the scientific method broadly disseminating its findings.<br/><br/>The proposed project advances our understanding of the MSA-LSA transition by addressing the question: Did seasonal changes in resource availability influence human behavior across the MSA-LSA transition? Three objectives will be used to address this question through stable isotope analysis of serially-sampled fossil herbivore teeth from Pleistocene fossil sites: (i) using strontium isotopes to reconstruct Pleistocene migratory systems; (ii) using carbon and oxygen isotopes to evaluate how migration relates to precipitation and dietary seasonality; and (iii) assessing how seasonality and migration have shaped human foraging strategies and technological change during the last glacial period. Understanding the ecology of animals during glacial periods through these methods is essential to grasping the full picture of the evolutionary ecology of both living and extinct species, with implications for human evolution, biology, and conservation. Furthermore, this study will be the largest ever to evaluate serially-sampled strontium isotopes in this research context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This meeting will be attended by graduate students and postdocs, and will bring together senior and junior researchers from broad ranging disciplines to discuss and advance our understanding of all aspects of the machinery and function of bacterial cells, with sessions on cell division, cell fate and decision-making, cellular organization, morphology and dynamics, cell envelope structures, cellular motility, and cell-cell interactions.  The application of novel light and electron microscopic techniques will be presented and discussed, as well as the ability to perform single-cell studies on bacteria. The interactions of cell biologists, microbiologists, biochemists, and biophysicists will increase understanding of these cells, and engage with and train junior scientists (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and beginning assistant professors).  This engagement is a priority of the conference, along with extensive poster sessions to allow interactions between senior and junior scientists.  NSF support will be used to defray registration fee and/or travel costs to allow attendance of participants from these stages of their careers, especially for members of groups historically under-represented in this field.<br/><br/>The science presented at the Bacterial Cell Biology and Development GRC will cover the biochemistry and cell biology of a wide variety of bacterial phyla, including talks on the asymmetry and dynamics of intracellular organization, membrane biogenesis, compartments within bacterial cells, cell wall mechanics and biogenesis, and the wide range of structures, developmental strategies, biochemistry, and movement of many different bacterial species, including free-living and commensal bacteria, and animal and plant pathogens. The diversity of disciplines represented among invited speakers and discussion leaders - ranging from genetics, cell biology and biochemistry to biophysics, bioinformatics, and modeling - and abundant opportunities for interactions among all conference participants is expected to inspire innovative thinking and potentiate new perspectives and research directions in the field.  In addition to advancing fundamental understanding of bacterial cell biology and development, given the relative simplicity and modularity of bacterial systems, the science presented at this conference may be leveraged to advance synthetic biology and other industrial applications. Education of a wide range of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will increase the critical mass of future independent investigators studying these organisms, which are critical to understanding animal and plant health, ecosystems, and the environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The primary goal of the GRC was to advance our understanding of bacterial cell biology and development from a mechanistic to a systems level, and across bacterial phylogeny.     We promoted innovation and interdisciplinary thought by including speakers and discussion leaders with diverse training, experimental organisms, and approaches. Significant advances in the field requires integration of multidisciplinary approaches, the study of diverse bacterial species, and interactions between individuals trained in different disciplines to inspire innovation. Our invited speakers and discussion leaders included biochemists, geneticists, physicists, microscopists, structural biologists, and cell biologists who bring diverse expertise and approaches to the foremost challenges in the field. In addition, rather than focusing on a few model systems, they are investigating BCBD in dozens of bacterial species that occupy diverse niches, lifestyles, and branches of the phylogenetic tree.  In addition to bringing together a diverse array of researchers in BCBD, we provided ample opportunity for formal and informal interactions among them to provide avenues to forge meaningful interactions that persist after the end of the GRC. These included daily unstructured time in the afternoons for informal conversations, daily poster sessions for one-on-one interactions between presenters and other conference-goers, substantial discussion time following each oral presentation, shared meals, and social time each evening.  We promoted equity and inclusion by inviting and supporting women and individuals from groups underrepresented in science to present and interact at the GRC. 50% of our invited speakers and 50% of our discussion leaders were women and/or are from underrepresented groups in science. We attracted additional speakers, poster presenters, and attendees from underrepresented groups by providing registration fee support, by promoting the GRC programs that support individuals from underrepresented groups, and by broad advertising through conventional means (i.e. print journals and direct email) and through social media. We held a GRC Power Hour to facilitate a dialogue among all attendees centered on equity and inclusion in science.  Finally, including the voices and perspectives of young scientists, and providing opportunities for their career development is a critical goal of our conference. Six of our invited speakers and five of our discussion leaders were new independent investigators. 19 of the talks selected from submitted abstracts were presented by students and postdoctoral fellows. We promoted engagement of students and postdoctoral fellows by requiring that the first questions after any oral presentation were from trainees rather than established investigators. In addition, we identified two trainees to serve as \"Social Chairs\" for the conference;  they will developed and promoted &ndash; with assistance and support from the Chairs - activities that encouraged interactions among trainees and other conference attendees. Critically, we offered registration support for postdoctoral fellows and students to support their ability to attend and participate fully in the conference.

        "abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Busisness Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving landfill diversion and recycling rates of non-industrial waste. This project targets high-traffic venues (HTVs) with controlled waste streams such as stadiums, universities, airports, and theme parks. Waste stream sorting to differentiate classes of materials for recycling and landfill is currently undertaken either using rudimentary, labor-intensive manual sorting, or expensive and technically complex robotic sorting, neither of which are feasible options for small- to mid-sized facilities (i.e., HTVs), which then shoulder heightened rates imposed by material recovery facilities due to contamination. These expenses have discouraged recycling, contributing to the mounting waste problem. This project seeks to develop an intelligent waste-sorting system that leverages computer vision and innovative hardware to enable on-site, decentralized sorting, facilitating the recapture of the 66 million tons and $200 billion worth of recyclable materials that currently go to waste each year. By mitigating waste accumulation in landfills and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with virgin resource mining, this technology supports United Nations sustainable development goals 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 12 (responsible consumption and production) and aligns with the NSF\u2019s mission of advancing national health, prosperity, and welfare. <br/><br/><br/>The proposed technology consists of a hardware-software solution that uses the latest in computer vision to perform automated singulation (i.e., arranging objects in a 1-by-1 stream) and classification in cluttered environments, allowing for increasingly complex (or diverse) structures (shapes, sizes, and materials) to be accurately identified and subsequently sorted. This approach produces an ordered stream of objects, which can then be sorted according to any diversion scheme for efficient recycling. The software uses semi-supervised learning to allow for domain adaptation from a centralized training set, enabling rapid implementation of optimized sorting schemes of site-specific waste streams, requiring significantly less human intervention than traditionally needed. Successful development would result in a simplified sorting platform that is cheaper, more robust, and less resource intensive than existing waste sorting operations, thus offering a novel turnkey solution that could be feasibly adopted on-site.  Research objectives include: 1) Developing and evaluating hardware assemblies using electromechanical processes for waste stream singulation; 2) Developing software for efficient dataset generation and waste stream classification, particularly using semi-supervised learning and data augmentation approaches; and 3) Validating the developed system for high precision singulation and classification of recyclables under noisy like conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project supported the development of an intelligent robotic waste sorting system designed to sort waste streams on-site at high-traffic venues (HTVs) such as universities, stadiums, and airports. Through the development of this technology, rStream Recycling seeks to deliver an automated system for sorting waste into single-stream recycling, trash, and compost. Such a system will both improve recycling rates and reduce costs for HTVs, which face high fees for contamination in recycling streams. This Phase I project advanced both hardware and software capabilities, resulting in a cost-effective system for waste organization and computer vision-based object classification. rStream developed a prototype system demonstrated to perform at a sorting accuracy of 70%, with processing speeds of 3,600 objects per hour. On the software development side, rStream designed a data-efficient framework to facilitate model training in new environments, supporting a scalable and generalizable approach capable of handling the high levels of object diversity and noise typical in waste streams.   These results validated the system as a robust and domain-adaptable solution with processing capabilities well-suited to meet the needs of the target customers among HTVs. To date, the HTVs achieving the highest sustainability certifications have done so through costly on-sight hand-sorting operations, which is economically infeasible for most sites. With rStreams SingleSort technology, cost-effective, efficient on-site waste sorting will become more accessible to a larger range of customers, thus improving recycling rates and helping to meet sustainability goals. This Phase I project will lead to further improvement and expansion of the technology in Phase II, during which the system will be developed and tested through a pilot deployment in a real-world HTV environment. Alongside the pilot system, software capabilities will be further enhanced through the development of multi-task and vision language models, as well as through augmented and synthetic data. The successful commercialization of this technology will result in a simplified sorting platform that is cheaper, more robust, and less resource intensive than existing waste sorting operations, thus offering a novel solution that could be feasibly implemented at HTVs. By reducing contamination in recycling streams and capturing recyclable objects from discarded waste, adoption of this technology will translate to a more effective closed-loop recycling infrastructure.

        "projectOutComesReport": " The 2023 workshop on Functional Logic of Neural circuits: diamonds in the rough (FLNDR)  sought to motivate and strengthen  a community of researchers through presentations and discussions that focus on current challenges in cross-disciplinary circuits research, such as the application of computational approaches to connectomic, neurophysiological, and behavioral data. It brought together motivated participants who perform research that applies emerging  technology and computational approaches from diverse fields to  interrogate the functional logic of neural circuits and behavior. This  innovative new research community studies well-described neural circuits  in experimentally tractable animal model. Participants were be encouraged to share insights, opinions, and suggestions as preprints and when appropriate, as reviews and opinions in relevant open-access journals.   The goal of FLNDR is to offer mechanistic insights into the structure and function of neural circuits underlying natural behavior, integrating theoretical,computational, and experimental approaches. It welcomes theory-drivenstudies to understand complex or adaptive behavior. We encourage ideas that focus on the interaction between the nervous system, the body, and its environment in producing behavior that can benefit from the ever-increasing resolution and completeness of wiring diagrams extracted from connectomics datasets, and data sets for neural and muscle activity and behavior.  The three-day workshop was held in person and remotely in San Juan (PR) on February 22-24, 2022. Attendance included 17 in-person and 15 remoteparticipants. The workshop included 22 short (15-minute) presentations of original ideas and data, followed by round-table discussions and collaborative workgroups (https://sites.google.com/njit.edu/diamonds/2023-flndr). For the short talks, the speakers were asked to moderate a presentationand discuss a challenge that the speaker\u2019s research program needs to overcome, or ambitious visions that might require collaboration. Each speaker used that time as they liked. The round-table discussions were aimed at finding common threads among the issues compiling a list of challenges that were identified on the previous day, and organizing workgroups for the last day, The workgroups focused on initiating collaborative effort and generating publishable products.  Several new collaborations were  initiated during the workshop and they are at different levels of  progress (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06578 a collaboration  originated at FLNDR workshop). We expect that some of them will publish  reviews and opinion papers by the end of 2023.       Last Modified: 09/27/2023       Submitted by: Gal Haspel",

Specifically, it will study the impacts of the storm surge and associated flood deposit left by Hurricane Ian (September 2022) in Estero, Naples and Dollar Bay, Florida, and fringing mangroves. The study will compare the impact of this storm on urbanized estuaries vs. natural and wildlife areas. The project Broader Impacts include an improved understanding of how tropical storms impact the sustainability of fragile coastal systems in a rapidly changing climate regime. Educational Broader Impacts include field and laboratory research experience for undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow. <br/><br/><br/>The project will assess storm impacts by collecting sediment cores throughout the navigable portions of the bay systems, as well as fringing mangrove systems. Using a combination of visual observations, x-radiography of the cores and physical sedimentology of the sediment within the cores, the storm layer stratigraphy will be assessed. In addition, sediment samples will be analyzed for Total Mercury and Persistent Organic Pollutants or POPs (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)). A series of maps will be generated showing the thickness of the storm layer, the mean grain size of the associated sediment, and the contaminant loads for each of the respective contaminants assessed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  This project assesses the storm surge/flood deposit left by Hurricane Ian in Estero, Naples and Dollar Bay, Florida, and fringing mangroves in terms of both sediment and contaminant dispersal.Hurricane Ian (Fig. 1) made land fall at Punta Gorda, FL on Sept. 28, 2022, as a powerful Category 4 Hurricane, with sustained winds of 240 km/hr (150 mph) and predicted storm surges ranging from 2.5-5.5 m.In addition to the storm surge, the area received 36-43 cm of rainfall within the drainage basins of the coastal rivers and estuaries of the northern end of the study area, both adding to the flooding problems and delivering both sediment and contaminants to the estuaries.The study area ranged from where the eye of the storm passed through much of the southwestern dirty side of the storm, where the maximum wind and wave impact of the storm occurred.The study sites also range from heavily developed, urbanized estuaries largely consisting of cut and fill canal communities (e.g., Caloosahatchee River, Charlotte Harbor, and Naples Bay) to nature preserves and wildlife areas with natural mangrove shorelines and no development (e.g., Cape Haze, Pine Island Sound, Estero Bay, and Dollar Bay).      Field sampling occurred from May 13-18, 2023, where a total of 69 push cores and 4 vibracores were collected (Fig. 2).Upon returning to Texas A&M Univ.-Galveston Campus, each core was x-rayed to determine the thickness of the flood layer.Each core was split and analyzed using a Geotek Multisensor core logger equipped with an XRF scanner.The core logger acquired continuous ultra-high resolution digital photographs, color spectroscopy and XRF scans every 1 cm.Of the 69 cores, the tops of 43 cores were analyzed for14 PAHs and 28 PCBs.      Preliminary results of the analyses of PAHs and PCBs across the three coastal sites comprising the Caloosahatchee River, Estero Bay, and Haldeman Creek/Naples Bay, showed no detectable levels of PCBs. However, PAHs were detected across all three sites, with Haldeman Creek/Naples Bay exhibiting the highest levels of PAHs, at levels ~11x higher than those detected at Caloosahatchee River and Estero Bay (Fig. 3A&B).Gordon River (estuary) drains a significant portion of Naples, FL, including the Naples Airport which extends along the bank of the river.      Consistent across the three sites, the analysis of total PAH levels showed highest levels for samples taken closer in-land or nearer urbanized centers or discharges ((Fig. 3A&B).However, there is not significant deposition of dispersal of these PAHs away from these sites, suggesting that impact of Hurricane Ians landfall had minimal (or no) on remobilization/dispersal of polluted sediments away from the urban centers.

        "abstractText": "The Cnidarian Model Systems Meeting (\u201cCnidofest 2022\u201d) will take place September 7-10, 2022 at the University of California in Davis, California. This meeting will focus on cnidarians, a group of mostly marine animals that includes jellyfish, sea anemones, and corals, with a focus on cnidarians that are used as model organisms in the laboratory for molecular research to uncover the mechanisms underlying basic biological processes. Cnidarian model systems are growing in popularity due to dramatic advances in technology that now allow for sophisticated mechanistic studies; these studies are expected to have significant impact on many areas of society, including human health. Traditionally, most scientists have studied only a handful of model organisms because importing tools to new animals was a significant barrier. This has limited our understanding of biology because entire taxa remained severely understudied, including the cnidarians. However, due to significant and rapid advances in technology over the past 10-20 years, the number of laboratory model organisms has grown tremendously. This includes many emerging cnidarian models that will be featured at our meeting. A growing number of laboratories are applying these new technologies to cnidarians and making rapid progress in many fields, including developmental biology, cell biology, neurobiology, immunology, evolutionary biology, and ecology. Our meeting will highlight new tools that have already been implemented, introduce attendees to cutting edge technologies that may be applied to their future research, and facilitate the exchange of information between cnidarian scientists. This sharing of ideas will positively impact the advances we are able to make as a community. To ensure the healthy growth of our field, we will emphasize interactions between experienced scientists and trainees, with a focus on increasing diversity.<br/><br/>Cnidarians are excellent laboratory models for making fundamental biological discoveries in many scientific fields, including neurobiology, developmental biology, immunology, and ecology. New advances in technology are now allowing scientists to apply sophisticated technological approaches to this historically understudied group of animals. The advantages of cnidarians are many: 1) They have simple, well-understood body plans and interesting life cycles with high variability. 2) They hold an informative phylogenetic position as the clade that is sister to bilaterians; discoveries made in cnidarians are often reflective of deeply conserved processes. 3) Many life stages of cnidarians are transparent, making them amenable to live imaging. 4) Some cnidarians are models for studying self/non-self recognition and others are used to study intracellular symbioses, such as those found in reef-building corals. 5) Many cnidarians are great models for studying regeneration, stem cells, and aging. Our meeting will emphasize new technological approaches that will greatly enhance cnidarian research. Three technology speakers will present seminars on emerging technologies 1) CryoEM, 2) single cell multiomics, and 3) live imaging. In addition, we will choose abstracts that emphasize the development of new technologies, including science supported by NSF Enabling Discovery through GEnomics (EDGE) awards. Interactions will be fostered among participants through a schedule that includes oral presentation sessions, lightning talks, poster presentations, and free time to encourage informal discussion over breaks and meals, which are all done as one group. The goal is to exchange ideas for advancing technology in cnidarians, as well as to foster growth in the community through trainee support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "      Cnidarians, a group of animals that include corals, jellyfish, sea anemones, and hydroids, have a key position on the tree of life. As the sister group to most animals, they are critical to understanding the origin of animal features. Cnidarians have simple, but diverse, body plans, and are used to study features that are difficult to access in other organisms. For example, cnidarians have recently emerged as useful models for neuroscience because even though they have simple nervous systems, the molecular processes governing their nervous systems are deeply conserved. Cnidarians also have many unique traits and properties making them useful for addressing questions across diverse biological disciplines, including the ability to regenerate their entire bodies and to build multiple body plans from a single genome. The goal of this project was to organize a conference (Cnidarian Models System Meeting, aka Cnidofest) to bring together the community of researchers that study cnidarians, with a focus on supporting trainees. While cnidarians have already been used to make foundational discoveries in regenerative biology, developmental biology, and neurobiology, they have the potential to impact many other areas of biology if the community continues to expand and develop new tools. The community of researchers that study these animals is substantial, but still small relative to other model system communities. Growing and supporting the community is key to more rapid advancement in developing experimental methods. At this meeting, we emphasized exchanging ideas on the technical aspects of working with cnidarians, and we invited four speakers from outside of the community to speak about advanced methods in imaging, genomics, and in developing new model systems. Overall, this meeting provided a venue for the international community of cnidarian biologists to meet, exchange ideas, form new collaborations, and mentor the next generation of researchers. Critical to our community growth, we prioritized supporting our trainees at this meeting. We had 127 attendees and 75% of these were trainees. Accordingly, 75% of the oral presentations at the conference were given by students and postdoctoral researchers. In addition, almost all junior researchers presenting a poster also presented their work in a two-minute lightning talk that preceded the poster session. This grant helped us achieve this high percentage of trainee attendance by supporting 63 free registrations for trainees. To determine the overall satisfaction of attendees and to plan for future meetings, we conducted a post-conference survey that was taken by 50% of our attendees. Of those that took our survey, 94% agreed that the talk format was effective and that the meeting achieved a good balance of junior and senior researchers. Impressively, 97% of the survey respondents rated the quality of the science presented as either high or very high, which is a strong endorsement of our trainees. Our post-conference survey also indicated that the majority of attendees (79%) plan to attend the next Cnidofest conference, which is a testament to the success of Cnidofest 2022. Cnidofest 2024 is scheduled to be held on the campus of Lehigh University August 14-17, 2024 and planning is well underway. The establishment of this biennial conference, which started in 2018 with NSF support, for cnidarian researchers has served as a focal point for our growing and diversifying our community and for highlighting discoveries and advances with cnidarians.

        "abstractText": "The genomic revolution has ushered in a new era of biological research. Genomes have been sequenced for not only humans and traditional laboratory animal models such as mice and fruit flies, but thousands of diverse organisms. However, to turn this data into a deep understanding of how genes function, scientists need the ability to manipulate these genes in the newly sequenced species. Recent years have seen dramatic technological improvements to genome editing in several of these species, enabling direct tests. An NSF-funded symposium at the Society for Integrative Biology (SICB) in Austin, TX in January 2023 will shine a spotlight on research in diverse species to reveal new principles of biological function. Work presented aims to accelerate development of these tools in additional species by gathering gene editing experts to teach their methods to others. Using tools like CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, speakers have modified the genomes of species from jellyfish to mammals and many species in between. Studying many of the unique model organisms represented at SICB may have broad impacts including transformative knowledge advances, an understanding of ecologically important species, or medical insights. This symposium will help democratize gene editing tools to many species and advance knowledge of fundamental biological principles. <br/><br/>The advent of genetic manipulations has enabled incredible insights into genetic mechanisms that control biological processes. However, it has also promoted the consolidation of research into a limited number of species (eg, fruit fly, mouse, zebrafish, C. elegans). As a result, the genetic regulation of a tremendous variety of evolutionary adaptations across species have been understudied at a mechanistic level. The development of CRISPR/Cas genome editing, in particular, enables an expansion of the number of species in which genetic experiments can be performed. Some progress has been made in using gene-edited species to understand organismal biology in ways inaccessible with traditional model organisms. The goal of this symposium is to catalyze the transfer of knowledge and skills from researchers who have applied these technologies in new model organisms to scientists who would like to bring these approaches to their own research programs. A symposium at the 2023 Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) conference, which will feature talks, discussions, and a workshop. The speakers (who span institution types, locations, genders, along a spectrum of career stages) have modified species from jellyfish to mammals and many species in between. There will also be an educational event in which speakers from the symposium provide small-group consultations plus a panel discussion. To disseminate this work, all speakers have agreed to publish data presented at SICB in Integrative and Comparative Biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Importantly, this tool can be used in species not commonly studied in research labs, accelerating those species? potential to yield insights into central biological principles. Therefore, we organized a symposium at the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology to bring together scientists using gene editing in such non-traditional species. The goal is to teach others how to use these tools in their own labs. We had 13 talks over the course of two days, a panel Q&amp;A discussion, and a workshop, all designed to demonstrate how these experiments can be performed, to provide real-world advice, and to enable networking of scientists with experts in these tools. We had hundreds of scientists viewing the talks and participating in the Q&amp;A. The workshop provided personalized advice to dozens of scientists considering gene editing in a broad swathe of species. These species are important to study for a variety of reasons, including their invasive ecology (eg, lamprey), their unique behavior (eg, electric fish), or their disease relevance (eg, mosquito). Thus, our symposium?s intellectual merit spans the broad domains of the many research labs whose work will be accelerated by gene editing tools. The broader impacts of this symposium include the building of community among biologists with common interests, plus the potential for future advances in understanding ecology, disease vectors, and basic neuroscience principles.

        "abstractText": "From September 18-20, 2022 Hurricane Fiona delivered more than 64 cm of rainfall to the island of Puerto Rico. This excessive precipitation caused mass wasting and flooding across the island, similar to the effects of Hurricane Mar\u00eda in 2017. Both events represent extraordinary opportunities to study the impact of tropical cyclones on the evolution of a high relief, tropical landscape. This project will support two deployments of scientists and equipment to collect time-sensitive and perishable data from two catchments in southern Puerto Rico strongly impacted by mass wasting after the hurricane. Using these catchments as a model study area the investigators will: 1. survey the topography of landslide deposits, scars, and post-landslide river aggradation using drone-based structure-from-motion photogrammetry; 2. collect samples of river sediment downstream of landslide areas for grain size analysis and cosmogenic nuclide tracing of landslide-derived sediment, 3. monitor and record the movement of still-unstable landslides and actively aggrading river channels with time-lapse cameras. The project will be collaborative with co-investigators based in Puerto Rico and coordinated in concert with federal and local scientists working in hazards assessment and prevention. Field work deployments will engage at least 3 graduate and 3 undergraduate students.<br/><br/>For more than sixty years, geologists have debated the contribution of large, yet infrequent storm events to the long-term evolution of eroding landscapes. For large storms like tropical cycles, the immediate geomorphic impact to tropical landscapes may be obvious: mass wasting and flooding. However, the extended response of tropical landscapes to the storm event is often more complex, and measurement of landscape response requires repeated observations across a catchment area, beginning immediately after the storm event. This project supports collection of time-sensitive and perishable data to explore three hypotheses concerning the response of a tropical landscape to landslides and flooding caused by a tropical cyclone. Specifically, the investigators will address the questions: 1. Where (and why) do storm events destabilize hillslopes? by surveying landslide scars and deposits in-person, monitoring still-unstable hillslopes with time-lapse cameras, and mapping landslides regionally with remotely-sensed imagery; 2. How do river networks adjust to an influx of landslide-derived sediment? by measuring channel aggradation/erosion patterns with repeat drone-based topographic surveys and direct tracking of coarse sediment transport using time-lapse images of channels downstream of landslide areas; and 3. What is the residence time of landslide-derived sediment in a tropical landscape? by repeated measurement of cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations in river sediment to detect changes in the flux of landslide-derived sediment over the following year.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project supported rapid collection of topographic, photographic, and geochemical datasets in the year following Hurricane Fiona with two primary goals: 1. make time-sensitive measurements of perishable landforms and deposits before they disappeared, and 2. investigate how hurricanes may transform rivers subject to landsliding and flooding. We successfully collected water and sediment samples for geochemical measurements and samples are currently queued for analysis at Purdue University. We also successfully collected a variety of remote sensing observations, including time-lapse ground photography, drone surveys for structure-from-motion photogrammetry, and satellite images. Results from this work was presented in two student-led presentations at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting and are currently being finalized for publication. Survey data has been submitted to OpenTopography for public access and geochemical data will be archived as it comes available.      Broader Impacts: This project was a successful collaboration between Georgia Tech (GT) and the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagez (UPRM). Field work supported four graduate and three undergraduate students from Georgia Tech, one graduate and five undergraduate students from UPRM. Subsequent computational work also included two Georgia Tech undergraduates, a visiting REU student and four URPM students. All students working on the project are members of groups traditionally underrepresented in the geosciences. GT and UPRM further coordinated with the NSF-sponsored GEER program to draft a technical impact report to share with agencies working to mitigate natural hazards in Puerto Rico. GT and UPRM have also coordinated with an NSF-supported Collaborative Center for Landslide Geohazards to present and lead sessions are two conferences: the ASABE Soil Erosion Research Under a Changing Climate conference in Aquadilla, PR and the AGU Fall Meeting. GT faculty and students also led a Spanish-language educational outreach visit to an elementary school to teach students about landslide hazards.

This will enable the use of computer modeling in the design of new compounds, materials and devices. The goals are to render multiscale simulations reproducible and accessible by the broader community. In that context, the project will address the notion of \"lab 2.0\", by which computer simulations replace laboratory experiments in tasks such as materials design and costly combinatorial searches for viable chemical processes.

The main driver of the proposed implementation will be a Python codebase which will carry out the part of current software that is not computationally heavy, but instead is code heavy where many lines of code are needed in typically non-object-oriented languages. This is key to obtain the desired cluster-topology-agnostic workflows. Longstanding problems related to computational scalability and code stiffness will addressed in a three-pronged approach aimed at developing (1) modular tools implementing modules with highly object-oriented codes (e.g., quantum, classical atomistic, and continuum solvers), (2) hybrid tools implementing combinations of modular tools in a way that best exploits high-performance computing architectures, and (3) hyper tools implementing a high-level data-enabled optimization strategy that generates optimal workflows combining several hybrid tools, thereby making the software of broad applicability and accessible to nonexperts.

        "projectOutComesReport": "   The completion of this project represents a leap forward in simulating complex systems across multiple time and length scales. The goal was ambitious: to build a family of modular intercommunicating tools representative of the typical levels of theory used for atomistic simulations of complex systems. The design of the project ideally allows the development of hyper tools aimed at simplifying the user experience, expanding the range of applications and the power of each tool taken individually.  Key to the project was the creation of Python interfaces for existing Fortran quantum simulation engines (QEpy). Not only this provided the core component for all the other tools, but it also democratized access to high-level simulations and their fine-grained details from more user-accessible and education-ready platforms, such as Jupyter/Colab notebooks.  In addition to the QEpy package, this project provided the community with open-source platforms like DFTpy, eDFTpy, and Envyron, each embedding alternative simplified models of the complex quantum mechanical atomistic world. The efforts were mostly driven by intense collaborative hackathon events, which underscore the project's commitment to collective learning and innovation. The regular collaboration and communication between the two teams and their collaborators have ensured that the full compatibility between these tools and future developments. These tools have become bedrocks for ongoing research, their value magnified by several workshops and training sessions thateducated users on their application. Training and professional growth formed the backbone of the initiative, as evidenced by the fruitful collaboration with the Paesani group and other partnerships. These alliances translated complex theories into practical, cutting-edgesoftware.  Outreach and communication were fundamental to the project, with the team disseminating findings through seminars, symposiums, and online portals. This wide dissemination strategy effectively brought the advancements to a broad audience, thereby narrowing thedistance between innovative computational tools and their practical application.  In summary, the project has set a new benchmark for computational science by merging quantum and continuum methods, nurturing a culture of shared expertise, and delivering tools that will sustain scientific research into the future. Its legacy lies in the enhanced discoveryit enables, exemplifying the power of computational tools to foster scientific exploration.

        "abstractText": "Homelessness encompasses a wide range of lived experiences, from housing instability to reintegration from incarceration, couch-surfing to street homelessness, and episodic to chronic, with some people having multiple experiences, changing over time. As a challenge facing communities nationwide, it is vital to ensure that policymakers and community members have high-quality, up-to-date, data and information about homelessness and the people who are experiencing it. This project will bring together people experiencing homelessness, policymakers, and other community organizations to design a platform for data sharing and collaboration. The platform will help to ensure that people experiencing homelessness can access services and resources, while also providing the best evidence possible for how social service organizations can best leverage their resources to serve this community. <br/> <br/>Our government-nonprofit-university collaboration proposes to co-create and pilot a community platform supporting data integration efforts allowing for more timely and tailored provision of wrap-around services when, where, and by whom they are most needed. The City of Austin previously has invested in more effectively using its data \u2013 a key example is the Affordable Housing Search Tool, which resulted from the 2019 Code for America Summit. The Downtown Austin Community Court (DACC) innovative Intensive Case Management program provides services to people on the homelessness continuum, including substance abuse treatment, counseling, assistance with public benefits applications, job search assistance, and temporary housing. Good Systems, a UT Grand Challenge, has partnered with DACC and other City of Austin departments to improve services for people on the homelessness continuum, including over 60 interviews with case managers and service providers, and over 100 surveys from people on the homelessness continuum. This platform will include a public-facing dashboard providing information at the Austin City Council District level creating a shared interface enabling service providers, users, and community members to obtain and share information about resource availability and needs. The back-end of the system will serve as a digital twin for the City of Austin, allowing for more accurate prediction of when and where resources will be needed, which will only be accessible to trusted organizational partners who complete a memorandum of understanding and a data sharing agreement. The system will empower users to make evidence-based predictions about future service and resource needs. Service providers will be enabled to provide more timely and tailored services to proactively address these community needs. Hence, the platform will bridge the gap between essential resources and services and community needs.<br/><br/>This project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program\u2014Track B.

First, we convened a workshop in Austin, with 55 participants, including representatives from local, state, and federal government; 18 nonprofits; and members of the community served. To explore the scalability and transferability of this research, we convened a second workshop, which we held online with 41 participants from 12 states and territories. The workshops revealed the main data collection concerns as lack of collection accuracy, consistency across organizations, and collectors limited resources. There was a shared grievance that organizations generally have their own data model for storage, making cross-organizational querying difficult. Many participants referenced the need for an easy-to-use interface with concise language and policies, and video interpretations, to help users comprehend the platform. Participants in both workshops emphasized the need for simplified reporting and data assessment with a data system accessible to people with different data literacy levels. Participants were not only concerned with the technical features of the platform, but they also provided recommendations for governance, ongoing collaboration, and concerns about social and organizational sustainability.   A key outcome was that local workshop findings have the potential to be transferred to a broader context, and that similar concerns exist in data collection, use, and management for social service provision despite significant regional variations in resources, governance, and approach. During the workshop, representatives from the Ending Community Homelessness Coalition (ECHO) heard from homelessness service providers that are unable to pay the Homelessness Management Information System (HMIS) licensing fees, which creates a barrier to getting access to data, including data that they entered into the system. Since our workshop, ECHO informed our team that they have waived the HMIS licensing fees for all service providers in the Austin/Travis County Continuum of Care (CoC). This is a vital step in ensuring equitable data access given the important role that ECHO plays in managing data for the community.

        "abstractText": "Understanding how species cope with disease in an era of global change is of fundamental importance to the field of ecology and to the stability of wildlife populations. Anthropogenic deforestation is frequently associated with increases in wildlife disease. These patterns are expected to stem from both landscape-scale processes, such as changes in animal movement and disease transmission, and fine-scale processes, such as changes in the community of microbes that inhabit animal tissues (collectively termed the microbiome), but the interplay between these multi-scale processes is unresolved. This project investigates the relationship between deforestation and the microbiome to explain patterns of disease emergence across a range of disturbed environments, using amphibians of Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest as a model system. Work here stands apart from previous studies by integrating landscape-scale and microbe-scale processes into a unified framework that will advance microbial, disease, and global change ecology. This project implements a diversity recruitment program for graduate students with support from the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program at the University of Alabama and other funding sources at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. In partnership with the Alabama Museum of Natural History, portable mini exhibits and school activities w will be manufactured and implemented to narrow the K-12 science education gap in one of the most underserved areas in the nation. It is predicted that these exhibits will reach 66,000 students annually in five county school districts in Alabama.<br/><br/>The diverse assemblages of microbes that inhabit vertebrate hosts, collectively termed the microbiome, are vital to animal health. However, links between the host microbiome and emerging wildlife diseases are rarely considered within a landscape ecology framework. Repeated exposure to pathogens may alter community dynamics within the host microbiome and can promote competitive microbial interactions and host responses that may enrich the microbiome with anti-pathogen members. This form of acquired pathogen resistance, termed microbiome memory, may facilitate host recovery and prime the host after subsequent pathogen exposures. Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation notoriously restricts host movement at the landscape scale, which may alter rates of pathogen exposure that are critical for establishing microbiome memory prior to seasonal increases in pathogen pressure. This project will investigate interactive effects of anthropogenic habitat disturbance and host microbiome dynamics as a mechanism to explain observed increases in disease risk in fragmented landscapes, using amphibians of Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest as a model system. The selection acting on amphibian skin microbiomes in a survey of three amphibian species with seasonal pathogen dynamics across a gradient of landscape fragmentation will be examined. Also, field experiments will be conducted using microbiome manipulation, host translocation, and radio telemetry to test for mechanisms linking habitat fragmentation, disease, and the host microbiome independently from other components of host immunity. This work will generate a robust dataset integrating landscape ecology with a metacommunity theory of adaptive microbiomes, with novel implications for host resistance to disease and the maintenance and stability of biological diversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Intellectual Merit:   Amphibians, a diverse group of vertebrates, face global threats such as habitat loss and a devastating fungal pathogen, especially in tropical areas. Our research has shed light on the role of the amphibian skin microbiome, revealing that these microorganisms coexist with their hosts and frequently offer protection against pathogenic infections. Through our studies, we have explored the protective role of naturally occurring amphibian skin bacteria against the harmful chytrid fungus in the context of habitat loss and fragmentation. This research found strong evidence that discontinuity between natural forests and aquatic environments, a major factor in the historical decline of tropical amphibians, may lead to an imbalance in their skin microbiomes and increase the risk of fungal disease. Among our novel findings from field studies, we found that amphibian declines in Brazil linked to environmental degradation could be attributed in part to disease (Becker et al. 2023, Biological Reviews), and that high connectivity among multiple classes of natural habitats (e.g., forests, streams) is an important driver of amphibian microbiome health.   From an experimental perspective, we published an innovative study showing that vaccinating laboratory amphibians can change their skin microbes in a way that helps protect them from future fungal infections (Siomko et al. 2023, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B, Figure 1). This discovery, highlighting how vaccines can influence the microbiome to provide protection against pathogens, has attracted significant media attention due to its relevance to current discussions about how vaccines work. In addition to these two studies, during the course of this proposal we identified additional patterns and processes of how environmental degradation increases disease risk in amphibians through interactions with the amphibian skin microbiome, including microbiome composition (Martins et al. 2022, Animal Microbiome), stress hormone levels (Neely et al. 2023, Communications Biology), presence of macroparasites (e.g., helminths) (Neely et al. 2024, Royal Society Open Science), frequency of wildfires (Schuck et al. 2023, Scientific Reports), and droughts (Buttimer et al. 2024, Ecology Letters).   From the early days of this NSF-funded project, our research has developed from small-scale experiments to continental-scale data analyses integrating microbial ecology, global environmental stressors, and the conservation of tropical amphibians, the most endangered group of vertebrates. One of our recent studies illustrates well how this project evolved, revealing that endangered amphibian species from Madagascar and Brazil harbor fewer species of beneficial skin bacteria compared to similar non-threatened species living nearby (Greenspan et al. 2022, Animal Microbiome). These findings, led by Becker Lab researchers, highlight how global change stressors, including habitat loss and fragmentation, are reducing biodiversity at multiple scales, potentially weakening disease defenses in already threatened animals facing extinction.      Broader impacts:   This award has been instrumental in establishing PI Beckers research career as an early-career academic. It has also created valuable training opportunities for a diverse group, including two postdoctoral researchers, three graduate students, and several international visiting scholars. Additionally, the project included the design and production of a series of exhibits that condensed scientific knowledge on microbiology, wildlife conservation, and environmental change into laser-cut 3D-printed modules. These portable mini museums, each the size of a vending machine and equipped with various types of interactive media, were deployed along with educational activities in public schools and libraries across western Alabama. The aim was to bridge the science education gap in one of the nation's most underserved areas in STEM.

However, the wide variety and size of emerging datasets often make analysis challenging on current high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures because system configurations cannot be customized to process the data efficiently. This project will acquire and deploy a dynamically composable computer infrastructure called the Kentucky Research Informatics Composable Cloud (KyRICC). This KyRICC architecture will support complex data analysis pipelines with highly heterogeneous hardware requirements not currently supported by current HPC infrastructures. As a result, this project will enable and support a wide range of new research activities. KyRICC will be used by hundreds of University of Kentucky (UK) researchers (faculty, staff, and students) and by other computational research collaborators at institutions across the region including Centre College, Morehead State University, Eastern Kentucky University, University of Louisville, Northern Kentucky University, and Kentucky State University. As a leading-edge system, KyRICC and the exciting projects it makes possible will help recruit students, including students from groups underrepresented in STEM, to computational research. The system will also enhance the research training of many undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in Kentucky colleges and universities.<br/><br/>The KyRICC architecture will support complex data analysis pipelines with highly heterogeneous hardware requirements across individual data analysis steps. Specifically, KyRICC will integrate four subsystems that will enable dynamically composable cloud infrastructure: (1) A cluster of peripheral-composable compute nodes, allowing for up to 10\u2019s of GPUs and 10\u2019s of TB of main memory on a single node. Groups of nodes can be dynamically allocated to allow the training and inference of very large deep learning models and datasets; (2) A next-generation high-speed NVMe-based storage cluster capable of efficiently serving large volumes of data to multi-GPU nodes. Unlike traditional clustered storage systems, this composable filesystem allows the partitioning of storage on the project-level, allowing us to isolate data and better manage system performance; (3) A Peta-scale storage system provided by UK\u2019s current research storage infrastructure, providing a total of 2.2 PB of storage; and (4) An innovative workload management system for dynamic infrastructure composition, workload profiling, model and infrastructure tuning, supporting common pipelines and machine and deep learning models through templated projects. KyRICC will be a regional computational resource and will also be made available to the broader national computational research infrastructure through the NSF-supported ACCESS projects. Areas of expected breakthroughs in KyRICC-enabled research include deep learning and computer vision; natural language processing and multimodal embedding; computational modeling and simulation with data analytics; and omics analysis and systemic integration.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE) Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This KyRICC architecture will support complex data analysis pipelines with highly heterogeneous hardware requirements not currently supported by current HPC infrastructures. As a result, this project will enable and support a wide range of new research activities.   While GPUs have been part of HPC deployments for many years, recent advancements in the application of accelerators across machine learning, omic analysis, and simulation, have greatly increased demand. Accelerator workload diversity has also increased, with large language models requiring multi-node scale for the training and inference of single models. Conversely, reinforcement models, like those used in digital twin simulation, might require many GPU instances, but in a much smaller capacity. It is increasingly important that HPC systems implement features to better adapt available resources to specific workloads.   The Kentucky Research Informatics Composable Cloud (KyRICC) was created to provide flexible yet specialized infrastructure in support modern computational research. KyRICC is composed of five densely connected (IB 4x400Gb/sec + Eth 2x100Gb/sec) nodes NVIDIA DGX nodes, each with 8 X H100 80G GPUs. The total cluster provides 40 x H100 GPUs (3200GB vRAM), 10TB of CPU RAM, 174TB of onboard NVMe storage, and 560 CPU cores. Accompanying computational infrastructure are management and login nodes. While deployed in a secure environment, the cluster is equipped with dual purpose login/data transfer nodes with 100G connectivity to Internet2. Fractions of a node can be isolated for computation or the entire cluster, supporting a wide range of computational needs.        The compositional features of KyRICC provide a foundation for process, resource, and data isolation. Building on these features KyRICC supports workloads with protected and sensitive data. While the system can be used for general purpose computation, optimized pipelines have been developed and validated for accelerator-dependent workloads, such as large multimodal models, accelerated omics, and digital twin / time-series analysis.

        "abstractText": "This research aims to understand the role of the movement of waves through the mucosa of the larynx (voice box) during phonation (the formation of sounds). The mucosal wave is the flow-induced elastic wave that propagates in the superficial layer of the vocal fold. Through the wave motion, it controls the glottal air pulses, which form the primary sound source of the voice. Yet, the fundamental questions of how vocal fold biomechanics and flow loading determine the mucosal wave properties, how the mucosal wave properties affect the glottal flow dynamics, and how the flow dynamics determine the voice outcome, remain elusive. This research aims to answer these questions through an integrated computational study. A high fidelity computational model will be developed that describes voice production in all its complexity, including neuro-muscular stimulation, glottal aerodynamics, flow induced vocal fold vibrations, acoustics and their highly complex nonlinear interactions. The computer model will be validated against experimental data that has previously been collected from in vivo canine specimens. The cause-effect relationship between the mucosal wave properties, glottal flow dynamics and voice outcome will be systematically and quantitatively studied through parametric studies.  This research will greatly advance the current state of knowledge regarding voice production, including how voice is controlled.  This knowledge will allow better understand how we use and control our voice. It will also enable development of diagnosis metrics for mucosal wave related voice diseases, determine the adjustments to the vocal folds to restore or improve a damaged voice, and predict the outcome of the adjustment. It can also help people who use their voices excessively (e.g. teachers, telemarketers) by providing them with the knowledge for how to efficiently use and control their voices, with the goal of avoiding damage. Strong collaborations with the University of Maine Communications &amp; Speech Disorders Department will include the development of multidisciplinary courses focusing on speech and the introduction of the developed voice simulator into the educational and training program for future practitioners in speech pathology as well as education for speech disorder patients.<br/><br/>The mucosal wave propagates through the superficial layers of the vocal fold.  It is induced by flow and controls the movement of air through the glottis, which then produces the sound during speech and other forms of phonation.   More importantly, its strong interaction of this elastic wave with the glottal flow generates complex flow patterns and morphologies, such as dynamic flow separation, intraglottal vortices, vortex shedding, shear layer instabilities and transitions to turbulence. All of these factors significantly enhance the complexity inherent to the voice. The foundational questions that will be addressed focus on vocal fold biomechanics, glottal flow dynamics, and how the dynamics of the wave affect the production of the voice.  This will be addressed through an integrated multiphysics computational study.  The integrated educational component involves strong collaboration with the Department of Communication and Speech Disorders.  A multidisciplinary course will be developed to educate both speech pathologists and engineers on the underlying biomechanics of speech.  In addition, the simulation system developed will be directly employed in the training of speech pathologists and in the education of individuals suffering from speech disorders.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  This research aims to develop a high-fidelity multiphysics computational model to simulate the intricate interactions of flow, structure, and acoustics during voice production. Specifically, we investigate the characteristics of mucosal wave, a flow-induced elastics wave propagating on vocal fold surface in controlling airflow and generating sound. By understanding how the mucosal wave is influenced by vocal fold biomechanics and impacts the resulting voice, we can gain insights into voice usage and control. This knowledge may lead to diagnostic tools for voice diseases related to the mucosal wave, guidance for adjustments to damaged vocal folds, and predictions of the outcomes of such adjustments.   We've developed a muscle mechanics model that simulates passive and active responses of laryngeal muscles during voice production. This model, integrated with a flow-structure-acoustics interaction model, accurately simulates vocal fold posturing and vibrations, airflow dynamics and voice acoustics in response to various laryngeal muscle activations. Additionally, a 3D continuum mechanics-based laryngeal model was developed, incorporating realistic canine anatomy based on MRI scans. This detailed model consists of major laryngeal features, such as the conus elasticus, paraglottic space, cartilages, and muscles. The was extensively validated against in vivo experimental results, confirming its accuracy in predicting vocal fold posturing and vibrations under different laryngeal muscle activation scenarios.   We also established a computational framework for the virtual optimization of implant configurations for type 1 thyroplasty. Utilizing patient-specific laryngeal structures reconstructed from MRI images, this framework seamlessly integrates a muscle mechanics-based laryngeal posturing model, a flow-structure-acoustics interaction voice production model, a real-coded genetic algorithm, and virtual implant insertion. The framework successfully showcases optimized implant configurations that restore acoustic features in a diseased voice resulting from unilateral vocal fold paralysis during a sustained vowel utterance.   Using these computational models, we conducted simulations in normal, diseased (unilateral vocal fold paralysis), and surgically corrected (Type 1 thyroplasty) larynges. Our investigations focused on understanding the intricate relationships between muscle activations, vocal fold postures, internal stress, vibratory dynamics, glottal flow dynamics, and acoustics. We explored how laryngeal muscle contractions impact vocal fold biomechanics, how changes in biomechanics affect vocal fold vibration (mucosal wave properties), how mucosal wave properties influence glottal flow dynamics, and how these flow dynamics determine the overall voice outcome.   Developing real-time high-resolution 3D images of vocal fold vibration faces challenges due to limited organ accessibility and low temporal/spatial resolution in imaging and reconstruction. To address this, we created a groundbreaking physics-informed neural network (PINN) algorithm. This hybrid approach combines a recurrent neural network model for 3D soft tissue with a differentiable fluid solver, allowing inference of 3D flow-induced tissue dynamics from sparse 2D images. The results demonstrated the algorithm's ability to accurately reconstruct full 3D tissue dynamics and other complex physical quantities, including aerodynamics and acoustics. This advancement has significant implications for medical diagnosis, extending beyond current morphological and 2D dynamics criteria, and expanding measurable quantities in experimental and clinical research, thereby enhancing biomedical research capabilities.   The research has also fostered a diverse and collaborative learning environment involving undergraduate and graduate research assistants, as well as high-school students. Three undergraduate and three graduate students were trained comprehensively, covering various aspects of medical image processing, numerical simulation, data analysis, 3D printing, conference presentational and journal manuscript writing. The PI also collaborated with the Communication Science and Disorders Department at the University of Maine to integrate engineering concepts into speech pathology lectures for speech practitioners, developing specialized content for both undergraduate and graduate courses. This initiative included introducing a cutting-edge voice simulator prototype to visually illustrate physiological processes impacted by engineering principles. Additionally, the PI provided research training to two high-school students, engaging them in numerical modeling, simulations, data analysis, and presentation delivery. This holistic approach not only advanced the team's research goals but also contributed to the education and training of future engineers and speech pathologists.

        "projectOutComesReport": " Researchers and practitioners across disciplines have drawn on the theory of contextual integrity to tackle privacy issues. The recent efforts include operationalizing contextual integrity and what it means, discovering contextual norms for privacy, capturing users\u2019 privacy expectations in varied contexts, as well to analyze regulations and using contextual integrity to establish research ethics guidelines. Recognizing common interests and challenges, it is important to bring this diverse community of researchers using contextual integrity together to discuss what has been learned from the projects using this privacy theory and how to move forward to leverage contextual integrity for enhancing privacy preserving systems and policies. This workshop assembled computer scientists, engineers, legal scholars, social scientists and ethicists to foster communication between the various communities of researchers and practitioners using the theory of contextual integrity as a framework to reason about privacy and use it as a common language for sharing of ideas. The workshop developed new collaborative interdisciplinary research partnerships around the theory of contextual integrity with existing communities in industry, academia, and government, and established a body of significant literature for future work on privacy enhancing systems. This workshop also facilitated interdisciplinary connections amongst privacy researchers in social science, law, computer science, ethics, and policy to produce more reliable and readily adopted privacy-enhancing technologies. The workshop broadened participation in computing by providing 11 travel grant awards and in-person mentoring opportunities to a diverse set of students including under-represented and marginalized populations. Travel grant awardees reported feeling welcomed into the community and gaining new insights into privacy theories and how they could apply to their own research. Almost all grant awardees reported feeling a sense of belonging as part of this interdisciplinary community and indicated that they are very likely to attend the event again in future. Overall, the travel grant award enabled the goals of broadening participation by bringing newcomers into an interdisciplinary community focused on addressing key issues around privacy and ever increasing pervasive technologies.

        "abstractText": "The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB) administration currently works with a patchwork of data silos that limits their ability to identify and address the needs of their residents. This project defines a central \u201cdatabase of record\u201d containing a comprehensive set of indicators about LTBB residents and their community, such as their demographics, health, education, the economy, the natural environment, employment, housing, public safety and transportation. The database incorporates tribal knowledge in addition to standard community indicators, and includes key terms from the tribal language. This project is an important component of supporting tribal nations\u2019 effort to develop data strategies and data sovereignty. The project incorporates technical advances in the design of this database, including: integrating existing data sets with large variations; interpolating missing values; addressing data equity, using this database to inform future data collection strategies, and making the database easy to use by tribal government employees in multiple departments and with varying levels of technical skills.  <br/><br/>Data collection is expensive, and hence must be used sparingly. This project uses a smart mix of integration and interpolation to minimize the need for fresh data collection. It builds upon the team's past work on data equity to ensure that the results obtained are equitable. In past research, there have been many recent technical advances that facilitate collecting, integrating, and analyzing data. Nevertheless, such advances often address one component of the data-driven decision making process, and integrating multiple such advances into a data project can be challenging because of the many real-life \u201cwrinkles\u201d that get assumed away in most academic research.  This project identifies and addresses key considerations that are often missing in an academic research environment, and thus advances research generalizability through real-life deployment in a scenario with high social value. In Stage 2 of this project, the team will build a database of record, along with query facilities that are easy to use.  The resulting database of record will drive the strategic direction of the tribal government, including through better targeted effort in seeking and allocating resources, and through better identifying citizens with unmet needs.<br/><br/>This project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program\u2014Track B. Bridging the gap between essential resources and services &amp; community needs\u2014and is a collaboration between NSF, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our primary partner for this project was the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB), a native American tribe in Michigan. Specifically, the Niigaandiwin Education Department of the LTBB government was our lead partner. The goal of the partnership was to assist multiple LTBB government departments to develop an inventory of current data sets and facilitate coordinated data access.   The project also included two additional civic partners: the Dearborn Public Health Department (DPH) and the Downtown Detroit Partnership (DDP). The goal of the DPH project was to improve the Affordable Care Acts required Community Health Assessment in the city of Dearborn by consolidating data collected by DPH, Google, and WSUs Phoenix platform. By leveraging these inherent data collection and visualization systems, more efficient, and cost-effective decisions can be made for applying city-wide interventions. We have worked with DPH to design a data flow that can meet these requirements   The Downtown Detroit Partnership (DDP), established in 1922, is dedicated to cultivating economic and social impact in Downtown Detroit by fostering collaboration among the public, private, and philanthropic sectors, overseeing the stewardship of public spaces, and creating programs that engage and benefit all stakeholders. Central to DDP's mission is the collection and analysis of data. Through the development of the Downtown Datascape, businesses, patrons, and researchers have access to concise reports and dashboards summarizing the growth and development of downtown over the past several years. We analyzed DDPs data flow and made recommendations for an improved design.   The intellectual merit of this project is in the transfer of cutting edge technologies we have developed in our research work on usable data management, and the assessment of their deployment in practice. The broader impact of this project is in assisting organizations serving under-privileged segments of our society to make better use of their data and hence to be more effective in serving their constituencies. A secondary broader impact is in exposing University students, and other project personnel, to the needs and challenges faced by segments of society that they may otherwise have limited exposure to.

Many animals exhibit extraordinarily predictable behaviors even in the face of extreme external disruptions. What sensory signals do these organisms receive that allow them to consistently coordinate their motor responses despite these disturbances? The symposium featured a diverse array of speakers from different types of institutions and multiple career stages who exemplify the integrative approach to the mechanosensory field. Symposium speakers examined a variety of ideas regarding the role of mechanosensation in animal behavior beginning with how mechanosensory feedback is integrated into movement and how animal models can inform the development of robotic systems. New work in the fruit fly model highlighted how mechanosensory feedback contributes to complex motor control. Mechanosensors within the central nervous system were explored in avian, zebrafish, and lamprey models. The role of mechanosensation in spinal cord regeneration and functional recovery was also discussed. Finally, behavioral work demonstrated how mechanosensation contributes to feeding ecology in ducks and social behaviors in chameleons. In addition to the main symposium talks, a scheduled complementary session featured student speakers as well as senior researchers. The symposium speakers contributed articles for a special issue of the SICB journal, Integrative and Comparative Biology.   Our primary goal was to encourage researchers working across organisms to synthesize ideas and develop a shared research agenda for the field. We succeeded in this goal as evidenced by the collaborative review papers published by several presenters which present new perspectives and directions for the field.

        "abstractText": "One challenge for cities, especially under conditions of global climate change, is developing effective ways to keep residents safe from extreme heat. Within cities, historically marginalized neighborhoods often have measurably higher temperatures and fewer economic and social resources to mitigate the impacts of heat. The participation of these groups in planning how cities address heat is critical. To improve urban resilience to increasing temperatures and heat waves, this project develops a civic-engaged planning process that integrates strategically deployed sensor technologies with a community-informed data hub to forecast areas most in need of heat reduction intervention. The project will train city youth to collect, monitor, and communicate data on urban temperatures and experiences of heat through a citizen science program integrated with public decision-making processes. This project involves academic, government, public schools, nonprofit, and resident partners from the City of Roanoke, Virginia.<br/><br/>This project incorporates novel linkages between processes of resident and organizational learning, social trust, coordination, and governance capacity necessary for long-term adaptation. The project builds on a previous place-based STEM and urban planning citizen science program implemented in Roanoke, VA. The current citizen science efforts will be expanded to include the deployment of wearable temperature sensors and stationary temperature monitoring equipment, as well as training youth in Photovoice methods using photography to document the effects of heat on their communities while simultaneously learning the language of urban planning. Key research questions include: (1) How do informal educators characterize leverage points to engage families around citizen science and heat resilience? (2) How can civic technologies help forge collaborations necessary to proactively address extreme heat in cities? and (3) How can digital infrastructure for diverse types of data be designed to facilitate how residents and government officials make sense of the problem of extreme heat and priorities for heat resilience? Outcomes include the deployment of a civic technology platform that will be co-designed with government officials, residents, and academic partners to incorporate the quantitative and qualitative data generated through youth and family engagement, as well as the development of replicable materials and methods to increase diverse citizen participation in increased urban resilience to the impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>This project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program\u2014Track A.

        "projectOutComesReport": " This project brought together representatives from city government, academia, and non-profit organizations to collaboratively develop a novel approach to dealing with the problem of extreme heat in cities. Heat already causes more deaths each year in the United States and worldwide than any other weather-related phenomena. Global climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves and is expected increase their impact on human health and the economy. In cities, the effects of heat are exacerbated by the ?urban heat island effect,? the term that describes the empirical observation that temperatures in cities are higher than temperatures in the surrounding rural areas. Within cities, temperatures are also not uniformly distributed. Temperatures are hotter where large, heat-holding infrastructures are located (roads, overpasses, etc), where development density is high, and where there is little vegetation, tree canopy, and shade. In US cities, these areas also tend to be dealing with many other social stressors, including high levels of gun violence, lack of affordable housing, eviction and homelessness, systemic racism, food insecurity, poverty, and lack of transportation options. While urban planners value the participation of residents in any planning effort, elevating the importance of adaptation to climate change with the most vulnerable residents often feels disingenuous because of the many other issues these residents are facing, many of which are perceived to be much more pressing.  Through numerous listening sessions, interviews, and focus groups, this project co-produced an approach to adaptation and resilience planning that addresses the challenge of ensuring authentic, representative engagement of the communities most affected by extreme heat in resilience planning. Co-production refers to a collaborative process of integrated different kinds of knowledge together, including: scientific and technical knowledge, policy process knowledge, as well as the local and experiential knowledge of residents. We involved many organizational actors in the co-production process, including: city government officials (Office of Sustainability, City Manager?s office, Planning Department, Parks and Recreation), other public employees (Roanoke City Public Schools, Public Libraries), religious congregations, community artists, mental and behavioral health and youth development organizations, and academic researchers from multiple disciplines (urban planning, forestry, engineering education, public health, environmental humanities, and computer science). These organizational actors met in multiple settings in order to elicit different perspectives around the idea of the problem of urban heat (What are the boundaries of the problem? What is the nature of the problem?), as well as ideas about the meanings of ?resilience? and how community resilience can and should be improved. The groups also determined what data and kinds of analyses were necessary to effectively plan for heat resilience and how to connect these plans to implementation, for example through concrete items to be incorporated into the city?s capital improvements plan. In all, this grant enabled: three ?all hands? workshops, four focus groups, over 20 individual meetings/interviews, a pilot Photovoice project with Roanoke teens exploring the concept of resilience, a Virginia Tech master?s studio exploring the concept of ?heat resilience infrastructure,? and a pilot wearable temperature sensors campaign.  Through these co-production activities, the group refined a unique approached to resilience planning, which we called, the ?Roanoke Method.? The Roanoke Method acknowledges existing individual and intergenerational traumas present in the neighborhoods most vulnerable to the risks of extreme heat and deep distrust between these neighborhoods and city government. The Roanoke Method is a trauma-informed, healing-centered approach to building community capacity to adapt to rising temperatures. It involves partnering with organizations in the work they are already doing ? community/youth/spiritual development ? and making clearer the relationships between trauma and heat, and community healing and civic engagement and urban nature. Youth-centered activities were identified as a meaningful way to engage communities that have been underrepresented in public decisions.  Through the researchers? participatory action research approach to both elevating the voices of those marginalized and to integrated multiple sources of knowledge, the Roanoke Method itself aims to reveal how inter-organizational relationships and social learning can occur in the resilience planning process. The work of this Stage 1 Planning Grant led to the successful submission of a Stage 2 Full Award, with the Roanoke Method, featured centrally. The intellectual merit of the approach is to reveal how cross-organizational partnerships affect conceptualization of the problem of extreme heat; as well as create inclusive approaches to the resilience implementation gap. The Stage 2 proposal includes projects with community arts and youth development, and spirituality groups, a workforce development program for Roanoke high schoolers coupled with Virginia Tech graduate students in urban planning and forestry, and close integration between civic involvement and city decision-making processes to re-establish trust.

        "abstractText": "This project aims to serve the national interest by providing training in data science to undergraduate attendees at the Southwestern Psychological Association (SWPA) Conference. Attendees will come from two- and four-year institutions of higher education, and up to twenty five students will receive funding to take part. The purpose of the project is twofold: 1) to provide a data science education undergraduate-level workshop at the SWPA annual meeting, and 2) to increase diversity in data science by equipping diverse psychology students with data science skills. The primary focus of the undergraduate educational workshop will be to build participants\u2019 knowledge of data science and increase their ability to employ data science methods in research. Skills that will be reviewed in the training include acquiring, visualizing, and managing data and performing specialized analyses. Using readily accessible, social media data (e.g., Twitter or Facebook) with broad applicability across interests, textual nature, and amenability to network analysis, workshop instructors will guide attendees through a high-level look at the process of developing a research proposal that utilizes big data. Additionally, attendees will learn how the study of psychology and data science can be mutually beneficial, and also gain exposure to career paths and options from a panel discussion involving data scientists. <br/><br/>Enhancing psychology undergraduate training via data science education would provide an opportunity to examine and address validity and fairness issues in coding of natural language and algorithm training/validation. Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the fastest growing areas of machine learning research. Current linguistic machine learning models do an adequate job on language-understanding tasks, but the patterns learned in the data have been shown to produce algorithms that often express stereotypes and social biases. Stereotypes, prejudice, and implicit bias are a major focus of social psychological curriculum and training. If psychology education not only included theories and concepts surrounding these topics but also data science methodology, psychology students could conduct research that would assist in the optimization of machine learning models to reduce implicit biases. Thus, the proposed conference workshop will demonstrate the relationship between STEM learning in formal and informal settings by providing a unique informal setting (conference workshop) where student learning takes place but has not been assessed or compared to learning that happens in a typical classroom setting. Through the informal learning environment of the conference this workshop will (a) provide context and purpose to formal learning, (b) provide students opportunity and access to data science professionals, and (c) extend STEM content learning environments and student engagement. Participants knowledge development and attitude formation will be evaluated through direct measures of knowledge as well as qualitative methods. The findings from the assessment of this workshop will be developed into a mini-workbook and external-facing resource portal that will be shared broadly through the SWPA website and the American Psychological Association's educational directorates. The mini-workbook will also be shared with other psychological regional organizations and APA leadership to develop similar workshops and training for annual meetings and national conferences. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The goals of the workshop were to provide an alternative context and purpose to formal learning of data science, to provide students with access to data science research and career information, and to promote STEM content learning and student engagement. Twenty-five undergraduate psychology students attended the workshop and 18 of the attendees received travel support to attend. Of the 18 students supported, 17 were women, 6 were persons of color, and 2 identified as having documented disability.   All attendees were provided training and skill development to utilize data science software (R studio and R program) and data science approaches to address psychological research questions. All attendees had previously completed a statistics course as a part of their psychology undergraduate program so the workshop training allowed for building upon knowledge of descriptive and inferential statistics. Additionally, attendees engaged in a group activity that allowed them to develop a research question and plan using data science approaches.   The conference workshop aimed to demonstrate the relationship between STEM learning in formal and informal settings by providing a unique informal setting where student learning could take place but has not yet been assessed. Attendees of the workshop completed a pre and post quiz that focused on data science content and scores were compared to identify changes in learning and understanding of data science approaches, methodology, and career information. Overall, attendees rated their satisfaction with conference workshop content as \"very satisfied\". Additionally, attendees stated that they would recommend their peers attend the conference workshop in the future.   Although quantitative analysis revealed attendee's pre-post quiz scores were not significantly different nor were their quiz scores different from non-attendee scores, qualitative analysis revealed attendees included data science terminology and discussed data science concepts in their written responses more than non-attendees. They also recognized the utility of statistical modeling and data visualization in data science and had a better understanding of software and programming used in data science research, coding, and career options available. These results suggest the informal setting of the conference workshop aided in enhancing STEM learning.   The principle investigator and coordinator of the data science workshop have developed a mini workbook that outlines the development, preparation, workshop content, and implementation of the workshop.The mini workbook will be shared with undergraduate program directors in the SW region to provide a model and framework for incorporating data science training into psychology courses through the use of High Impact Practices (HIPs) such as team-based research projects and capstone projects. The mini workbook will also be shared with other psychology regional organizations and the American Psychological AssociationCommittee on Associate and Baccalaureate Education to develop similar workshops and training opportunities at annual meetings and national conferences.

The conference on Scholarly Teaching and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) in Linguistics will be the first of its kind. Participants will gain a better understanding of evidence-based instructional practices and collaboratively identify ways in which linguistics can help improve undergraduate STEM instruction more broadly. Faculty teaching linguistics at an undergraduate level along with graduate students interested in undergraduate teaching will be invited to the conference. Three overarching questions will guide the conference: (1) What are the strategic steps that can be followed as a discipline to elevate the use of evidence-based teaching approaches and the status of SoTL work as scholarly work within linguistics? (2) How can teachers of linguistics advance justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) in their classrooms and in the discipline? (3) How can linguistic theory and the teaching of linguistics inform the teaching of other sciences?<br/><br/>This project aims to serve the national interest by building capacity for scholarly teaching in the undergraduate linguistics curriculum. The two-day conference will advance the understanding of the state of teaching in linguistics and will support the creation and dissemination of new SoTL scholarship. Pivotal to this goal is the inclusion of instructors from different subdisciplines and different institutional contexts. The conference has the potential to advance linguistic pedagogy and the discipline of linguistics by allowing scholars to create and disseminate new SoTL scholarship and gain a better understanding of the state of undergraduate teaching in linguistics. With JEDI-centered conversations and working sessions, this conference intends to explore gatekeeping and barriers that may currently exist in linguistics instruction and the ways that different contexts shape the linguistics curriculum.

        "projectOutComesReport": "  The 2023 Conference on Scholarly Teaching and SoTL in Linguistics (CoSTaSiL) brought together linguists from different institutional, geographical, and personal backgrounds to share and discuss peer-reviewed presentations about the successes and challenges of teaching linguistics. A major goal of the conference was to refine our collective understanding of the status of scholarly teaching and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) in our discipline and to identify issues to inform strategic planning by the Linguistic Society of America (LSA), the flagship professional organization for linguists in North America.   The conference helped advance linguistic pedagogy and the discipline of linguisticsby allowing scholars to create and disseminate new SoTL scholarship and gain a better understanding of the state of teaching in our discipline. With our Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI)-centered conversations and working sessions, we explored the (un)intentional gatekeeping and barriers that currently exist in linguistics instruction and the ways that different contexts shape the linguistics curriculum. The conference built on recent publications that have acknowledged and challenged the colonial origins of linguistics, urged for intentional inclusion of students and scholars from marginalized groups whose languages have been exploited to advance linguistic theory, and pushed for decolonizing the field and our pedagogy.   The conference offered three major contributions: (1) advancing JEDI in the discipline of linguistics; (2) improving graduate student training in linguistics; and (3) using linguistic theory and the teaching of linguistics to inform the teaching of other sciences. Participants critically examined and reflected on their teaching practices through a JEDI lens. Through guided dialogue and strategic planning activities, participants are now better prepared to connect with students from a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences, and to serve as advocates for linguistic justice. This in turn will directly impact the introductory linguistics curriculum, the courses we offer in general education programs, and the undergraduate students who will feel welcomed into these courses. Graduate students were invited to participate and learn about evidence-based pedagogical approaches and the range of contexts where linguistics is taught. The conference experience helped prepare these graduate students who are planning to stay in academia, as well as the audience members who were undergraduate and graduate students. Our disciplines investigation of the language acquisition process by Deaf and hearing people, language variation and standardization, and ethical field work practices can help instructors in other science fields become more knowledgeable about language-based pedagogical issues. One of the intended conference outcomes of presenting and publishing our perspectives is that, through disseminating our work, we can contribute to, participate in, and lead pedagogical conversations with instructors outside of our discipline.   The two-day conference took place at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst as part of the biannual summer linguistic institute of the Linguistic Society of America. In addition to supporting two invited presenter whose expertise is inclusive teaching and SoTL, the conference featured 20 single and co-authored presentations from linguists from across North America. In addition to the 35 participants from 25 institutions, 75 members of the LSA were able to attend the conference both in person and remotely. Additionally, selected presentations were featured in an organized session at the LSAs annual meeting in January 2024, and are being published in a special issue of the Proceedings of the LSA to broaden awareness about key topics and themes to the greater LSA membership.

This included providing:  a critical perspective of the frame itself an assessment and advancement of human rights struggles around our key focus areas of race and indigeneity, migration, and the environment and human rights a deeper understanding of the work of the IACHR a critique of the United States role in the human rights struggle     Throughout the Conference, we offered a reimagining of rights in the Americas by exploring urgent questions facing the human rights system, including:  Is it possible to reimagine the human rights framework in a way that better addresses the current, ongoing and historical harms that are structural in nature?  What contours do human rights have in the demands made by social movements, and what does the human rights horizon or future look like?  How are these struggles being played out in the Americas, in the context of U.S. geo-political hegemony, and within the Inter-American human rights system?    The Conference was successful in stimulating dialog and discussion at the intersection of these themes and issues. An article assessing the Conference, co-authored by PIs Joseph Berra and S.

        "abstractText": "Empirical study of the Internet provides a foundation for understanding how the infrastructure is deployed, operated and used, and enables improvements in systems, protocols and processes.  However, empirical study is fraught with challenges in the collection and analysis of data.  Addressing these challenges is crucial to on-going empirical study of the Internet and to broadening the scope of measurement-based research. <br/><br/>This project will plan and direct a two-day workshop that will bring together about 30 experts from the fields of Internet measurement, statistics and mathematics to discuss current challenges and identify important and promising future research directions and opportunities. This workshop is motivated by the new NSF Internet Measurement Research: Methodologies, Tools, and Infrastructure (IMR) program, which is a collaboration between Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) to \u201csupport methodologies, tools, and research infrastructure for Internet measurement spanning access (both wireless and fixed broadband) and core Internet.\u201d  This workshop will provide a forum for researchers who work on different aspects of Internet measurement to communicate and interact with statisticians and mathematicians.  Specific opportunities for information exchange and collaboration between these communities include avoiding pitfalls in managing and analyzing large, diverse data sets, and creating novel methods for collecting, anonymizing, modeling, and analyzing Internet measurement data.  <br/><br/>The in-person workshop will be organized around keynote talks, focus group sessions and working group discussions. During the workshop, statisticians and mathematicians will have opportunities to learn about the current topics in Internet measurement research and the challenges and practical issues related to Internet measurement research. Likewise, Internet measurement researchers will have the opportunities to learn about the latest developments and advances in statistical models, algorithms and methodologies for collecting and analyzing large and complex datasets. <br/><br/>The workshop aims to facilitate interactions and encourage future collaborations between participants.  This will pave the way for research projects and will have a significant impact on the theory and practice in Internet measurement research, and will drive the development of new statistical and learning-based techniques. The workshop will also benefit the education and training of next-generation researchers and practitioners by exposing participants to new ideas and techniques spanning Internet measurement, statistics and mathematics.  A report summarizing the workshop will be published after its conclusion.

        "projectOutComesReport": "  The Workshop on Emerging Research Opportunities at the Intersection of Statistics and Internet Measurement was held in January 2023 at Boston University. The goal of the workshop was to bring together Internet measurement researchers and statisticians/mathematicians to identify important and promising future research directions and exchanging research ideas that could lead to future collaborations. Forty-two scholars from academia, industry, and the NSF participated. The workshop agenda consisted of a series of 17 keynote talks interspersed by small group discussions. Talks and discussions addressed a wide range of topics including Internet traffic analysis, connectivity and topology analysis, application and user behavior, challenges and opportunities in Internet data collection and data processing, cutting-edge models, and methodologies in different areas of statistics, applied mathematics and data science. More specifically, talks discussed selection biases and qualifying biases in estimates from crowdsourced and other non-random samples, process monitoring, anomaly detection, adversarial risk analysis, data protection, models and methods for network and Internet traffic data collection and processing, and advanced and innovative statistical models, methods, algorithms, and tools that can be applied directly in Internet measurement research.    The major outcomes from the workshop are twofold. First, the workshop was successful in facilitating introductions between participants from the Internet measurement and statistics/mathematics communities. Conversations in small group sessions were cordial and carried on beyond allotted times. Second, opportunities for future collaborations were clearly identified over the range of topics that were discussed from experimental design and data gathering to data analysis and modeling to data privacy and visualization.   Based on discussions during the workshop and follow-up conversations with participants, the following recommendations are made to the community and the NSF for next steps:    1) While the workshop was a success in terms of meeting the goal of bringing together Internet measurement researchers and statisticians/mathematicians, fostering collaborations between these communities that result in new research contributions will take time. Toward the goal of building meaningful and impactful research collaborations, we recommend future  perhaps annual - Workshops on Emerging Research Opportunities at the Intersection of Statistics and Internet Measurement.    2) The NSF Internet Measurement Research program (the most recent call can be found at https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22519/nsf22519.htm) is designed to support methodologies, tools, and research infrastructure for Internet measurement spanning access (both wireless and fixed broadband) and core Internet. It is often difficult to acquire funding for collaborative research efforts that span communities. Yet, such support is vital in Internet measurement since addressing many of the research challenges requires diverse skills and experience. We recommend that the NSF continue the IMR program to enable the nascent collaborations between Internet measurement researchers and statisticians/mathematicians to mature and expand.    3) Visualizations play a key role in conveying what is interesting and important in Internet measurement research. Images of time series, scatter plots, bar charts and graph connectivity are standard fare in Internet measurement research papers. However, in some cases, a visualization can be the highlight in a paper that captures and summarizes the major point of the work. In future workshops and/or funding programs, we recommend a visualization track that concentrates on new and innovative methods for visualizing network data and network-related information (e.g., for contextualizing), including novel data representation methods, animation tools, AR-based use cases, etc. should be considered.    4) A critical touchpoint between stats/math researchers and Internet measurement researchers is data. Unfortunately, in most cases, data is collected for a project and not preserved in a fashion that supports reproduction of results or future research. While there are groups that collect, archive and make data available to the community (e.g., CAIDA), there is a broader need to identify and support longitudinal data collection, archival and distribution. We recommend working toward community consensus around what longitudinal datasets should be valuable to the community and funding/institutional methods to sustain support for collection, archival and distribution of those datasets. One potential mechanism to encourage the follow-up that is required to curate and document datasets collected over the course of a grant would be a dataset packaging supplement that could be requested for any CISE grant (analogous to an REU supplement).    5) The Workshop on Emerging Research Opportunities at the Intersection of Statistics and Internet Measurement as well as the NSF IMR program specifically encourages collaborations between stats/math and Internet measurement researchers. We recommend encouraging broader crossdisciplinary research that could include social scientists, economists, etc. While such research collaborations take time and effort to build, they offer an opportunity to bring principled data gathering and analysis methodologies to bear on diverse problems, and to develop solutions that have important broader impacts. Fostering collaborations between Internet measurement, stats/math and researchers from other communities could be part of a future, expanded IMR call.

        "abstractText": "This award supports travel for participants in a symposium, Daily torpor across birds and mammals: Recent progress and how do we advance the field?, at the January 2023 annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB). Animals that experience unpredictable or energy-scarce conditions have evolved a variety of strategies to survive them. One such strategy is the use of torpor, by which animals lower their metabolic rates, heart rates, and/or body temperatures to minimize energy expenditure. The symposium focuses on recent research on daily torpor in birds and mammals, an area that has advanced quickly and expanded rapidly across animal taxa in the past decade. It will include research on the genetic mechanisms underlying daily torpor, and the main unanswered questions in the field will be summarized. The eleven invited symposium speakers represent a range of career stages, including a majority of early-career scientists, and use many different approaches to study torpor in birds and mammals globally (from tenrecs and primates to hummingbirds and bats, in Africa, North and South America, Asia, Europe, and Australia). Currently, there is very little consensus on common metrics that can be used to measure torpor across taxa, and a goal of the symposium is to develop useful metrics to advance the field. The symposium\u2019s overall goal is to share recent knowledge and foster a discussion on future research on daily torpor across vertebrate taxa. Results from the symposium will be disseminated by publication in the SICB journal, Integrative and Comparative Biology.<br/><br/>Daily torpor is a growing research field, due in part to technological advancements (e.g., increasingly portable respirometry, higher-resolution thermal cameras, smaller and more advanced physiological dataloggers) and expanded taxonomic scope. As a result, many researchers the world over have developed their own approaches to measure and describe the use of daily torpor in a range of species, but there has been little cross-talk between people who study mammal torpor and those who study bird torpor. The goal of the symposium is for early-career researchers to come together with more established researchers to discuss recent advances and approaches in the field and to discuss the gaps in knowledge to be addressed in future work. The speakers will present their research, followed by a round-table discussion involving the speakers and the audience. Future directions that the symposium will address include the use of genomic and transcriptomic data to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of torpor. Some of the broader impacts of studying torpor will also be addressed, including the potential impact on medical science, including induced hypothermia for safer surgeries and safe organ transplant by induced cooling, as well as developing induced hibernation for potential space travel. The symposium speakers will contribute papers for a special issue of the SICB journal, Integrative and Comparative Biology, which will include a future-oriented paper about unifying principles and future directions in the field based on the discussion at the end of symposium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  On January 5, 2023, we conducted a symposium on \"Daily torpor across birds and mammals: Recent progress and how do we advance the field?\". Torpor is a behavioral and physiological strategy where animals lower their metabolic rate and often their heart rate and temperature, saving energy. There has been a lot of progress in the field over the last 10 years, but very little cross-talk among researchers who study torpor in different geographies and taxa (birds vs. mammals). The field has also skewed more heavily towards studying the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hibernation (multi-day or multi-week torpor), than daily torpor.   We discussed the current state of torpor research, identified some issues with terminology, and talked about the big unsolved issues in the field. The potential for comparative studies across taxa that use daily torpor is really powerful, and by delving more into the comparative aspects of the mechanisms that regulate torpor, we can solve a lot of evolutionary puzzles relating to heterothermy and endothermy. There is such a diversity of strategies that have evolved in animals that use torpor. We especially identified four problems. 1. The definitions of torpor are arbitrary, and sometimes contradictory. This is a tough problem to solve, but we advocated for presenting more raw data, at least making it more accessible, (on request if needed), to allow for re-analyses in different contexts. 2. Many of our perceptions of what torpor is and how it is defined come from champion hibernators at high latitudes that use hibernation quite predictably, consistently, and deeply, relative to the diversity of ways in which torpor is more generally used. This has led to the torpor use patterns of some taxa being set as the standards, and others that use torpor in different ways being seen as weird torpor users. But in fact, so many tropical torpid users are weird torpor users. 3. Almost nothing is known about the genetic basis for torpor regulation among daily torpor users  this is a big unsolved question in the field. 4. Very little is known about neural regulation of torpor among daily torpor users. Some recent studies on mice have identified specific neuronal pathways that are crucial for torpor entry, but there is no taxonomic breadth in this realm so far.   We brought together 2 undergraduates, 2 PhD candidates/recent graduates, 2 postdocs, 2 Assistant Professors, and 3 Associate/Full Professors present in the main symposium. Additionally, we had 3 undergraduates and 1 graduate student in the complementary session. The symposium went largely as planned. We had two proposed speakers drop out; one PhD student who took academic leave and a Professor because flights were prohibitively expensive from Australia. Instead, we had two undergraduates present their work in the main symposium instead of as complementary session posters. We had speakers from four continents, with 6 women, 5 men, and one non-binary person. This breadth of participation, especially from non-US researchers, would not have been possible without the support we received from NSF and other sources.

        "abstractText": "Seafloor geodesy measures motion of the earth underwater. Current technology receives data from seafloor instruments by sending and receiving signals from the sea surface to the seafloor and back. However, this method has a depth limitation of ~3000 m which greatly limits where instruments can be deployed. This project investigates using a different technique which can be used in deep water that only requires the signals to travel from the sea surface to the seafloor. Broader impacts include support for a graduate student and partnering with an engineering company.<br/><br/>Seafloor geodesy remains a frontier area of geophysics. Suboceanic measurements of position and displacement made with high precision over long spatial and long temporal baselines hold the key to a variety of scientific questions of first-order importance, such as the long-term behavior of subduction zones and other areas where earthquakes nucleate. This project tests a new approach to GNSS-Acoustic seafloor geodesy using data from a field experiment acquired in 5225 m deep water. The system of GNSS-Acoustic geodesy (1) directly positions a material point (a Continuous Deep Ocean Geodetic sensor called C-DOG) on the seafloor (rather than a virtual point), (2) uses a one-way acoustic travel-time measurement by the seafloor beacon and (3) a non-stationary surface vessel that can survey multiple C-DOGs in rapid succession. (4) It furthermore leverages recent developments in GNSS processing techniques for precise point positioning of the acoustic transducer, (5) it is capable of remaining dormant on the seafloor for an extended time, and (6) it corrects for bias due to sound velocity errors as part of the inversion strategy. Workforce development includes a graduate student who will interact closely with engineering partners to develop the necessary expertise. Educational materials for outreach developed during this project will be widely shared to the scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Suboceanic measurements of position and displacement made with high precision over long spatial and long temporal baselines hold the key to a variety of scientific questions of first-order importance, e.g., to monitor tectonic motion in subduction zones, the locus of deep and strong earthquakes. Much scientific return has already been delivered by the geodetic community, but most attempts to date have focused on relatively shallow-water deployments. The limitations are methodological and scientific, technological and logistical-and, indeed, formidable. Pioneering GNSS-Acoustic approaches from the 1980s have fully matured, and recent community efforts have focused on identifying new techniques that reach deeper, see further, and last longer. In this one-year Phase I project we tested a new approach to GNSS-Acoustic seafloor geodesy using a custom-built system of deep-seafloor receivers, equipped with low-power atomic clocks. These long-lived beacons time-tag acoustic arrivals from a surface vessel, from which their position can be determined via inversion. We developed a methodological workflow for the analysis of a deep-water (5 km) test deployment from R/V Atlantc Explorer offshore Bermuda. The end products of our data analysis are methodological, and include the evaluation of the core question: what precision can be obtained from our new technique? We were able to formulate a suite of technological recommendations to inform a Phase II experiment with an autonomous surface vehicle, which we successfully conducted in deep (5 km) water offshore Puerto Rico.

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Given increasing world connectivity, the rise of antibiotic resistance, the expected increase in inequalities, and pressures on and from the environment, millions will be pushed toward higher susceptibility to infectious diseases and food shortage.   The mechanistic understanding and fundamentals of pathogen transmission have been historically relegated to a black-box, leading to recurring perceived contradictions, or confusions around preventive measures or policies deployed in time of crisis such as the recent pandemic. Pathogens are transported in and mostly by fluid phases - air, physiological fluids, water, etc. It is also increasingly clear that common fluid and biophysical constraints affect or can even drive a range of disease systems, from human respiratory, to nosocomial, to waterborne or crop diseases. Moreover, fluid physics has historically been absent from the pathogen transmission, microbial or viral-focused research communities; and it has remained historically separate from the fields typically incorporated in infection control and prevention policies, until very recently.   Infectious diseases and their study pose many challenges: from technical challenges in sampling, detection, identification of pathogen properties; the challenges of animal models and field studies and their inherent variability; to the need to translate insights from the lab to technical innovations in infrastructure or policy measures at various scales, for example, to be able minimize lockdowns and global societal impacts during emerging epidemics. These and many more associated challenges require first and foremost to root public health policies, including those pertaining to surveillance, early detection, and prevention, in rigorous interdisciplinary fundamental science dedicated to deciphering the mechanisms underlying contamination and infectious agent adaptation and transmission at various scales and in a range of disease systems and environments. To achieve this goal, traditionally disconnected scientific communities have to cross-pollinate. This new GRC aimed to provide participants a forum to exchange on fundamental and methodological frontier advances in interfacial and complex flows pertaining to health, broadly defined. In addition, we also engaged in state-of-the art discussions on challenges in infectious diseases and contamination, from viroscience, ecology, to microbiology, pertaining to humans, animals, and plants disease systems at various scales.

        "abstractText": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable one million Americans that suffer with the loss of ability to speak through disease of or damage to the larynx or mouth (aphonia). The inability to fluently communicate with other people has severe consequences. Voiceless individuals are three times more likely to suffer a preventable adverse event in medical settings than speaking patients, and this can lead to health problems and even life-threatening situations. Up to 50% of these adverse events could be avoided with adequate communication between patients and clinicians. The proposed solution is a video-to-speech software application that provides voiceless people with real-time communication assistance, especially geared towards medical settings. The technology could help prevent hundreds of thousands of adverse health events each year (costing $6.8 billion annually), with benefits for the voiceless population and the healthcare system in general. The innovation may improve voice restoration by providing real-time translation with no training needed and allowing complex messages to be expressed while looking eye-to-eye (an important part of human communication). Moreover, the technology does not require invasive installations nor complex equipment, is readily accessible, and has maintenance requirements that are marginal.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the intellectual challenge of overcoming the ambiguity of visemes when trying to automate lip-reading. Visemes (the gestures made when talking) and phonemes (the sounds produced with these gestures) do not share a one-to-one correspondence. This makes accurately predicting the intended speech based on visual information challenging. Previous researchers have failed to reach acceptable accuracy levels in the interpretation of visemes, while other tools only work with a few dozen words that must be structured according to pre-defined, fixed rules that are impractical. The main goal of this effort is to develop a combination of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural network transducers that is capable of accurately differentiating visemes and permits real-time, reliable voice assistance for voiceless people. Project objectives include: (1) pre-training an algorithm to detect phonemes using publicly available speech video, (2) optimizing the phoneme-trained algorithm against healthcare relevant vocabulary, and (3) alpha-testing of the lip-reading algorithm against real-time speech.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  For individuals who have lost their ability to generate voice, communication can be a daily struggle. This need is particularly challenging for individuals critically ill and in the hospital. This project set out to develop a groundbreaking lip-reading application, offering a new pathway for expression and a bridge for the current communication gap.   Three key areas drove our success:   1. Building a Diverse Training Dataset:  Enhanced      UX: LipTrain is how we get training data; www.liraglobal.com/liptrain. We enhanced      the platforms user-friendliness,streamlining the recording process      and integrating storytelling elements to convey the gravity of      voicelessness. Crowdsourcing      Power:Our LipTrain campaign rallied some 1,118 microvolunteers,      primarily through social media, collecting 7,269 videos showcasing a      variety of accents,ages,and ethnicities. Quality      Control:Clinicians and patients/family members verified the sentences      we ask LipTrain microvolunteers to read,ensuring our video dataset's      relevance to address the critical challenge of being voiceless while      hospitalized.    2. Refining the Lip-reading Predictive Algorithm:  Shifting      Gears:Our previous efforts focused on sentence-level prediction      requiring users to stick to a fixed set of phrases. We transitioned to a word-based      prediction,allowing for the flexibility we are accustomed to using.  First in class      prediction: We completed the project with a word-level prediction model      that functions at a 74-78% accuracy on a 195-word list inclusive of a      basic English and healthcare-centric vocabulary. Large Language      Models:Integrating LLMs significantly boosted the algorithm's      sophistication and understanding of language context. This enabled key      accuracy gains and offers promise in expanding the prediction vocabulary      to fluent English.     3. Creating a User-Friendly Interface:  User-Driven      Design:Initial layouts and wireframes were tested and refined based      on user feedback, ensuring a seamless experience. Word-Level      Integration:We designed the interface to seamlessly integrate the      word-level predictive model,providing real-time lip-reading      assistance.    This project is not just a technological feat; it's a beacon of hope for those who yearn to be heard. The positive user feedback fuels our commitment to refining this technology, expanding its reach, and ultimately delivering a product that transforms lives.   Our journey is far from over, but this breakthrough is a pivotal step towards revolutionizing communication for individuals facing voicelessness. We envision a future where our application empowers them to express themselves freely, participate in conversations, and reconnect with the world around them.   This is more than a project; it's a promise towards a world where everyone has a voice.     Last Modified: 04/25/2024       Submitted by: YiHan",

        "projectOutComesReport": "   Summary of activities For this Convergence Accelerator workshop series, we brought in 40 experts from a variety of groups -- from educational technology companies to philanthropic organizations to teachers -- to discuss potential solutions. Twelve subgroups of three to four experts per subgroup were formed within an assigned track. Over the course of three spaced sessions, subgroups were tasked to ideate deliverables in the key tracks of data science education, middle school math, and assessment. The group then discussed cross-cutting trends among them and provided feedback to each other during facilitated advisory sessions. Field need The motivation to organize this workshop series was largely spurred by the 2022 NAEP scores, which exemplified the biggest drop in Math and English scores in over three decades of the tests\u2019 administration (National Center for Education Statistics, 2022a). Behind these drops in scores was an unsurprising reality within the field of education and development of technologies in the crest of the pandemic: while some exemplary, highly-effective educational technology platforms experienced up to tenfold increases in userbases (Gillespie et al., 2022; Baker et al., 2022), the pivot to emergency online education mostly consisted of attempting to teach in traditional ways but through Zoom (Bonk, 2020; McArthur, 2021), using credit recovery platforms and learning platforms already under fire for low quality (Ball &amp; Grimaldi, 2021), or using untested approaches (Ter&auml;s et al., 2020; Aguilar, 2020). This pivot proved less than adequate, particularly for low-income students (Kuhfeld, 2022) and students from historically marginalized groups (Dorn et al., 2021). Outcomes/Accomplishments Two key outcomes of this workshop series included a 77-page document with many ideas of educational technology deliverables, along with notes on workshopped ideas. A third key outcome of this workshop series included the completion of a report, \"Transforming Educational Technology Through Convergence,\" capturing the key themes and necessary partnerships that experts believe are critical for improvements to educational opportunities. It then examines the key disciplines and convergence required to produce deliverables capable of transforming the educational landscape in the US. This document is particularly useful for sharing among philanthropic, research, and educator communities to efficiently identify areas of urgent need for development within the field of education, and key areas of trends in educational technology designs that have potential to work well for students\u2019 diverse needs. Contributions to the field &amp; broader impacts This workshop series contributed to the field in its identification of potential innovation, research, and development for educational technologies to reach students. Investing and further developing these innovations offers potential for broader societal impacts on students and educators.    The middle school math deliverables focus on increasing student motivation, the relevance of math concepts and skills, supporting collaborative and project-based learning, optimizing and expanding feedback mechanisms, and developing AI to respond to students\u2019 inputs. These innovations will help unveil more about achievement and opportunity gaps and other mechanisms that affect groups of students differentially in STEM domains. Through supporting middle school math education that is relevant to students\u2019 lives and integrates social learning, student motivation for math will increase. Optimizing and expanding feedback mechanisms will help focus teachers\u2019 efforts, enabling them to more easily differentiate instruction and focus their time and attention on students who most benefit from it.  The data science education deliverables focus on preparing students with procedural skills to work with data and supporting teachers to provide timely feedback on data science-related assessments. Intellectual merits of these deliverables include understanding the paths to how data science education will be integrated into mainstream curricula&ndash;or developed and taught as its own subject (Engel, 2017)&ndash;given its interdisciplinary nature. Through supporting data science education that emphasizes increasing motivation and relevance and using AI to build resources and assist teachers, we can build data science curricula that teach this complex domain drawing upon many disciplines and skill sets. Data science is an inherently convergent field, making it hard for many teachers and students; a convergent approach to teaching it can prepare students for careers and lives where understanding data is paramount.  The assessment deliverables focused on the development of new, increasingly unobtrusive ways to assess students, including elements such as gamification and assessing a broader range of skills (such as self-regulation and collaborative learning). Intellectual merits of these deliverables include deeper understanding of  learning processes, creating broader impacts through more valid, less disruptive, and more comprehensive assessments. Through continued research and development, the next generation of assessments can more reliably measure what students know, how they learn, and how instruction can be adjusted in terms of cognitive, metacognitive, self-regulatory and socio-emotional skills that students need to learn most effectively. These new assessments can also provide teachers with real-time information that is less disruptive to the learning process than traditional forms of assessment.

To address this need, this university-community collaboration aims to revolutionize the next generation of emergency services by applying state-of-the-art AI techniques to response systems that will reduce emergency response times while increasing their accessibility and equity. To do so, this project takes the following steps: 1) automate responses to non-emergency requests and thus ensuring 9-1-1 dispatchers are available to provide quick assistance to those who may be adversely affected by emergencies; 2) precisely ascertain emergency response times, which can maximize the efficiency of the placement of stations and response units and potentially result in an improved (insurance services) ISO rating and lower insurance rates for the citizens and businesses, 3) extract on-scene information to support first-responders operations to save lives and time during emergencies, and 4) create a community-centric approach to ensure equitable and trustworthy emergency and non-emergency response systems.<br/> <br/>This planning grant aims to identify sources of inefficiency, inequity, and inaccessibility present in existing emergency and non-emergency response systems and remedy them by developing novel AI-based interventions.

        "projectOutComesReport": "  Emergency and non-emergency services act as critical gateways between residents and first responders. Despite first responders and governments doing their best to be responsive to public needs and emergencies, the sheer volume of emergency (911) and non-emergency (311) calls, coupled with a severe labor shortage, have put immense strain on existing infrastructure local government infrastructure in the USA. To scale these critical services, cities across the USA have relied on technological advancements (e.g., automation and data-driven decision-making). However, such efforts have often been ad-hoc, and have not included the community and key stakeholders (including residents, first responders, local non-profit organizations, and domain experts) in the design process. Unfortunately, this commonly used design paradigm has, at times, adversely impacted responsiveness to the community at large and vulnerable and marginalized populations in particular. Two critical questions confronting governments in their efforts to automate aspects of emergency and non-emergency response systems are: 1) how to avoid forms of automation bias that have been found to disproportionately affect historically underserved communities? 2) how to design principled data-driven infrastructure to enable automation and set the stage for improved and more efficient resource allocation? To tackle these challenges, we have assembled a strong and diverse team of computer scientists, social scientists, first responders, city officials, and community organizations to fundamentally transform emergency and non-emergency response for the 700,000 residents of Nashville, Tennessee. To navigate the risks of automation, we develop a community-centered design methodology that emphasizes values of inclusion, accessibility, and trust. We pair this community-centered methodology with cutting-edge artificial intelligence and automation techniques to ensure that emergency and non-emergency services are more efficient and accessible than before.   We summarized the primary outcomes of this project below. For more details, please refer to our final report.   First, we collaborated with community partners to develop a community-in-the-loop approach to automating inefficient aspects of the City of Nashvilles non-emergency response centers. The goal of this approach is to ensure automation efforts do not impede equitable access to non-emergency response systems, especially for more vulnerable segments of the population. Our second innovation focused on using natural language processing to automatically answer and process non-emergency calls (311) with automated and equitable voice-based systems to assign requests to corresponding agencies, generate service reports, and update callers on the status of their requests. The system integrated novel techniques, including deep learning, natural language processing, voice-to-text, human-in-the-loop intelligent system design, and confidence-guided control, which contributed to the development of the research field and have the potential to be extended to other applications.   Secondly, we had a series of activities with community groups and stakeholders.We had three workshops with our city and community partners. During these workshops, we invited first responders from four other cities to learn from their experience and national wide demands in emergency response, industry partners (e.g., Amazon, Presidio, Cisco) to identify existing industrial solutions and gaps, and senior leadership from our community partners to design our approach from a community perspective. We conducted an extensive survey of 400 residents in Nashville to understand existing bottlenecks in 311 response and, had three community listening sessions and dived into the key issues and challenges in (non-) emergency response. Additionally, PIs and GRAs visited the Nashville Fire Department to study the fire engines and devices and discussed the challenges with first responders to gain deeper insight into this issue. We visited the Communication Center and sat together with dispatchers to learn the procedure of answering emergency calls. PIs and city partners had weekly project meetings for discussion and reporting progress.   Thirdly, research findings were presented nationally and regionally through meetings and conferences. We also provided undergraduate research opportunities and utilized findings in this project demonstrating AI for social good in AI classes at Vanderbilt University and seminars hosted by ACM-W women in computing's Vanderbilt Chapter.

        "abstractText": "Despite decades of pandemic preparedness efforts, COVID-19 took the world by surprise. The national and global health community did not foresee the extend of challenges associated with charting ecosystems of potential threats, elucidating interdependent behavioral and political dynamics, and equipping decision makers with nimble science, strategies, and training. This project imagines a better prepared future for responding to pathogen threats and aims to build the basis for a Center for Pandemic Decision Science that will break down the persistent silos separating the academic, government, and industry institutions that have collectively, but not always collaboratively, guided pandemic preparedness and response efforts. Over the next 18 months, a team of 35 natural scientists, social scientists, computer scientists, engineers, physicians, and public health officials from 10 institutions will host a series of interdisciplinary workshops and undertake pilot studies that will lay the intellectual and organizational groundwork for tackling three fundamental research questions - How can we anticipate the vast universe of potential pathogen threats and detect them at their source? How will people, communities, and leaders behave and respond to emerging threats? How can we integrate science into decision making across the preparedness, containment, and response spectrum? For each of these questions, the team will identify immediate and long-term goals for basic research, training of scientists and decision makers, and development of predictive intelligence capabilities. These activities will establish a new research paradigm that is grounded in complex systems modeling, integrate perspectives and methods across diverse disciplines, and engage extensively with decision makers to ensure that the science is both relevant and practical. The project will broadly engage the research and public health communities through workshops and colloquia, train a diverse group of students, develop an undergraduate teaching module in pandemic decision science, and disseminate resulting insights and products through online platforms, media, and peer-reviewed publications. <br/><br/>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, this interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, social scientists, and clinicians has been developing mathematical models to provide situational awareness, actionable forecasts, and time-sensitive policy analyses for decision makers on all scales, from local to global. The team has partnered closely with government agencies, healthcare systems, and schools to provide predictive intelligence as the virus, human behavioral responses, and the arsenal of effective countermeasures continually shifted. This work has elucidated three interlinked grand challenges. The first is the global failure of imagination in anticipating novel pathogen threats, despite decades of concerted preparedness efforts. The second is the fundamental inability to anticipate individual, collective, and governmental behavioral responses during the threats. The third is the persistent gap between science and the decisions made by individuals, agencies, and policymakers. This project will launch a Center for Pandemic Decision Science that tackles these grand challenges by advancing the integration of complex systems science into pandemic decision making. As a first step, the Center will conduct a series of inclusive, multidisciplinary workshops and pilot studies that will spur innovative interdisciplinary research into the emergence and detection of novel threats, the dynamics of people\u2019s behavior, and the design and adoption of adaptive decision paradigms for preventing, tracking and mitigating pathogen threats under uncertainty. These activities will hone the Center\u2019s vision, identify key research priorities, and embark on a diverse portfolio of educational and community building activities to advance the science and practice of pathogen preparedness. <br/><br/>This award is supported by the cross-directorate Predictive Intelligence for Pandemic Prevention Phase I (PIPP) program, which is jointly funded by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO), Computer Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) and Engineering (ENG). This project was also funded in collaboration with the CDC to support research projects to further advance federal infectious disease modeling, prevention and response capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "      This 18-month PIPP Phase 1 project included four international workshops, five pilot studies, and a variety of outreach activities intended to lay the groundwork for an interdisciplinary center for advanced pandemic science. Our multi-institutional interdisciplinary team included 35 natural scientists, social scientists, engineers, physicians, and officials from over ten academic, non-profit, and government institutions. Our efforts were led by an eight-member steering committee with expertise spanning the four participating NSF directorates. The activities were organized around three major thrusts, as follows.   Thrust 1: Anticipating the evolution and dynamics of emerging pathogen threats. This thrust included a pilot study conducted at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Idaho in which a team of researchers evaluated existing and improved machine-learning (ML) techniques for anticipating SARS-CoV-2 antibody escape. The team held an international workshop at the University of Texas at Austin to advance the pilot study and develop a ten-year vision for future research in forecasting the evolutionary dynamics of emerging pathogens.   Thrust 2: Predicting the dynamic interplay between epidemiology, behavior, society, and policy that unfolds during a pandemic. We convened an international workshop at the Santa Fe Institute on Human Systems Dynamics During Crises which laid the groundwork for our PIPP Phase II proposal. Over 30 elected officials and experts spanning social psychology, cognitive science, computational social sciences, statistics, and epidemiology fostered new collaborations and innovative directions for understanding, tracking, and forecasting socio-epidemiological dynamics.   We also organized and led the HPC in the City Hackathon: Pandemics associated with the Supercomputing 2023 conference. Sixteen undergraduate and masters students from 10 universities, including 5 HBCUs, participated in the 96-hour event. They tackled three socio-epidemiological data challenges: predicting mass gatherings from cell phone mobility data, tracking socioeconomic disparities in protective behaviors (i.e., who could afford to stay home) from cell phone mobility data, and gauging receptivity to face masks and other pandemic policies from Reddit data. They found creative solutions while learning Github, data science, supercomputing, visualization, dashboarding, website creation, and scientific communication skills. Their products and presentations are available online. The Impact Award went to the team that showed that the ups and downs of Reddit sentiments mirrored the strictness of local COVID-19 policies.   Thrust 3: Advancing decision support and training to ensure intelligent responses to uncertain pathogen threats. We held two international workshops. The first addressed Tools to Reduce Uncertainty and Ground Policy at the University of Texas at Austin. Over 25 scientists, engineers, and officials, including the mayor of Austin, Texas, explored strategies bringing science to action, including warning systems, AI-enabled NPIs, and communication. The second addressed Simulation Games for Pandemic Resilience at the Santa Fe Institute. Over 25 psychologists, wargame designers, and large language model experts, including the Director of the CDC Office of Readiness and Response, explored new tools for advancing decision making. The discussions, innovative research collaborations, and visioning papers resulting from these workshops were incorporated into our PIPP Phase II proposal.   We also conducted two pilot projects. The first was a rigorous evaluation of the color-coded alert systems used by cities, states, and countries (including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to track changing COVID-19 risks and trigger policy changes. The results of this study are in preparation for publication. The second was the design and implementation of the Command, Control, Coordination and Communication (C3C) Game for pandemic preparedness. Collaborating closely with public health, emergency response and elected officials from across Texas, we conducted COVID-19 lessons-learned analyses and designed a simulation game to evaluate and improve emergency operations plans for emerging pathogen threats. We facilitated the game for over a dozen officials, who reported that the experience elucidated critical strengths and weaknesses of existing plans and structures.   Over the course of this project, we engaged over 40 institutions in one or more initiatives and provided research experiences for dozens of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduates, including many from underrepresented groups. We co-created and taught a new undergraduate course in Pandemic Science at the University of Texas at Austin and hosted 17 colloquia that were open to a larger scientific community.

        "abstractText": "The Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey (1931 to present) is the only long-term and ocean-basin-wide in-situ survey of plankton in the world. This award continues the CPR survey in the western Atlantic from Iceland to the eastern margin of the United States. It uses a consistent, cost-effective methodology deployed from ships-of-opportunity to continue a unique and invaluable time series of phytoplankton and zooplankton observations in the surface ocean. The primary objective of this project is to maintain the spatial and temporal integrity of the CPR time series and facilitate marine ecological research. Because plankton form the base of the marine food web, long-term and basin-scale observations allow us to understand how marine ecosystems respond to stressors such as climate change, acidification, eutrophication, and loss of biodiversity from fishing pressure, ultimately enabling ecosystem-based management of marine resources. Broader impacts include contributions to U.S. and international and integrated observing systems, marine policy, and marine resource management. Data from the CPR survey are made publicly accessible through the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office. In addition, maintenance of a sample archive will maximize its use by the wider scientific community.<br/><br/>This project observes and describes long-term, pelagic plankton variability and diversity in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The data are enabling scientists to interpret marine biological change and assess anthropogenic, climatically forced, and natural plankton variability over multi-decadal time scales. Scientific research is anticipated to advance a number of key lines of scientific inquiry that will incorporate responses of the marine plankton community to large-scale environmental change, how changes can impact ecosystem productivity, and how connected these changes are across the wider Atlantic. In addition, CPR research focuses on biodiversity and invasive species; sustainable use of marine bio-resources; and ecosystem health, ocean acidification, and micro-plastics. These themes are highly relevant to timely and compelling scientific questions, marine policy and management interests of the United States, and  broad societal concerns regarding the marine environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "projectOutComesReport": "  This award supports the major US-facing sampling effort of the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey in the North Atlantic, the longest running and most extensive marine plankton survey in the world. The survey captures the microscopic floating plankton in the open ocean using silk mesh in sampling devices towed along standard routes, and the many species of plankton are identified and counted by the CPR analyst team-over 800 types are identified. The plant-like phytoplankton are responsible for the majority of all photosynthesis on earth, using sunlight to draw carbon dioxide out of the air and water. They provide food for tiny animals-zooplankton, which themselves support the vast food web of all the larger organisms in the ocean, from fish to whales. Additionally, carbon fixed by plankton may fall to the ocean floor as marine snow, so changes in the plankton community affect both the oceans productivity and carbon budget. Plankton and the ocean food web they support are vital to humans and also being affected by human activities, ocean warming and acidification. Because the sampling devices are mechanical and towed behind commercial shipping, the carbon emissions associated with CPR survey activities are minimised.   Since 1931 the survey has covered over 7.2 million nautical miles (a Guinness World Record) and adds a further 10 thousand miles of tow each month: the long time-series of consistent measurements along each route enables us to identify changes and trends in the ocean due to man-made factors and climate change. NSF has maintained support for the CPR survey in the NW Atlantic (in particular the Z-route tows from Iceland to the US through major fisheries) continuously since 1990, and the survey database includes pre-1980s tow results for long-term comparisons. The CPR survey database currently includes over 250 000 samples and is freely available to researchers in the US and around the world. The data have formed the basis of hundreds of publications on climate change and the ecosystems of the North Atlantic. In addition to consistent coverage of the North Atlantic basin, survey work extends into the Arctic and Antarctic regions, and also covers part of the North Pacific, to the west of the Alaskan coast.   The CPR survey is the worlds only truly basin-scale marine biological survey and NSF funding ensures its continuity. Objectives of the project have been: maintenance of core observing system, maintenance of quality and expertise, innovative marine ecological research, data provision and model validation, new technologies and added value, international contributions and integrated observing systems and knowledge and policy transfer.   CPR Survey researchers and associated researchers published 19 papers in 2022 using CPR data, and contributed to ICES Scientific Reports. These publications included a variety of collaborations with US researchers; in 2022 the survey collaborated with researchers at Woods Hole, the Bigelow lab for Ocean Sciences, NOAA Fisheries, U. of Maine, Ocean Visions, UGA, U. of Kansas, the Smithsonian, UCSD, UVA and others.   Research themes in 2022 included studying the connections between plankton and much larger marine animals in the North Atlantic such as Sand eels and Sunfish. The range occupied by these fish was found to change over time, tracking changes in ocean temperatures and plankton productivity.   The size of the CPR dataset and the variety of organisms recorded also allowed researchers to investigate basic ecological questions about how and why diverse communities of organisms form, and how each kind of organism finds and occupies a niche in the community that enables it to survive and preserves biodiversity as a whole. The variety of different traits exhibited by competing plankton organisms was found to enable each species to find an opportunity to thrive as conditions vary over time and space.   The ecosystem services provided by the plankton community (the important functions of the plankton to humans and other organisms) can be assessed and tracked through time using CPR data. In particular CPR data was used to quantify changes in the activity of plankton which sequester carbon in the North Atlantic and Arctic and move it to deeper water.   The open CPR data (those taxa consistently recorded since 1958), are made freely available under a CC-BY license via DASSH, the UK Node of the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), hosted at the MBA. In 2022 the CPR dataset was downloaded over 700 times from DASSH. Using global data exchange standards the CPR data are harvested by a number of larger marine biodiversity aggregators including EMODnet Biology, EurOBIS and the global OBIS database. CPR data is downloaded thousands of times a year from OBIS (more than 3700 times so far this year). In addition CPR data provide a key component of data products developed by ICES, OSPAR, and the European Open Science Cloud Blue-Cloud Pilot to support policy, management and decision making.
